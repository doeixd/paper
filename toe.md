# Gravity, Spacetime, and Quantum Mechanics as Informational Constraints: A Unified Framework

## 1. Introduction

This framework proposes that three foundational aspects of physics, namely gravity, spatial geometry, and quantum behavior, share a common informational origin. Rather than treating these as independent phenomena requiring separate explanations, the framework suggests they emerge from a single underlying structure: the way informational constraints govern what configurations are possible and how systems evolve between them.

The central claim is this: physical law does not describe forces pushing matter around in a pre-existing spacetime container. Instead, physical law specifies the rules by which informational states update. Spacetime geometry, gravitational effects, and quantum indeterminacy all arise as consequences of these rules.

One might object that "information" is too abstract a foundation for physics. However, the framework does not treat information as a substance or a field. Information here refers to a relational measure: how narrowly a given configuration is specified relative to the space of possibilities permitted by physical law. This relational definition avoids the need to posit information as a new ontological primitive.

The following sections develop each component of this framework in turn.

This framework remains agnostic about the mechanisms by which localized, persistent subsystems arise within the global constraint structure. However, existing work on the Free Energy Principle (FEP) provides a natural complement at this level of description. The FEP characterizes the necessary dynamics of any system that maintains its identity over time: such systems must minimize a variational bound on surprise relative to their sensory exchanges. In the present framework, this principle can be understood not as an independent postulate, but as a local consistency condition imposed on subsystems embedded within the broader informational landscape *Ω*.

## 2. Gravity as an Entropic Phenomenon

### 2.1 The Core Proposal

The framework proposes that gravity is best understood as arising from informational constraints that restrict how systems can evolve locally. These constraints are encoded geometrically as spacetime curvature. On this view, gravitational behavior does not originate from a fundamental force. Instead, gravity reflects a statistical tendency toward configurations compatible with larger global possibility volumes. This tendency can be expressed as a gradient flow on an informational cost function defined over spacetime configurations. At cosmological scales, this flow appears as spacetime curvature; at local scales, the same variational logic governs the dynamics of persistent subsystems, where it is formalized as free energy minimization.

Consider what this means concretely. When matter clumps together, local order increases. One might expect this to decrease entropy. But the constraints imposed by this local ordering simultaneously expand the space of possible configurations elsewhere. Global entropy and dynamical possibilities increase even as matter becomes locally organized. Gravity, on this account, is the macroscopic signature of this constraint-driven evolution.

### 2.2 Relation to Existing Research Programs

This proposal aligns with the entropic gravity program initiated by Erik Verlinde and Thanu Padmanabhan, which treats gravity as a thermodynamic emergent rather than a fundamental force. However, it diverges by integrating this view with the causal set theory framework advanced by Rafael Sorkin and Fay Dowker. While causal set theory typically focuses on the discrete structure of spacetime itself, this framework extends the concept of discreteness to the underlying information processing events. Furthermore, it draws on the epistemic approaches to quantum mechanics championed by Robert Spekkens, suggesting that the statistical behaviors observed in these disparate fields share a common root in constraint satisfaction.

## 3. Spatial Distance as Informational Cost

### 3.1 The Core Proposal

The framework proposes that spatial distance is an emergent quantity rather than a primitive geometric one. Regions of higher information density impose stronger constraints on causal evolution. These constraints increase the minimal operational cost required to transmit causal influence between events.

This cost can be measured in several equivalent ways: required state updates, action, or channel capacity. The increase in this cost manifests as an effective increase in metric length. Curvature and relativistic effects follow from this principle.

To illustrate: two events separated by empty space require fewer computational steps to influence each other than two events separated by a region of high informational complexity. The latter separation is effectively larger, not because more "space" exists between them, but because more constraint must be navigated.

In information-theoretic terms, this cost can be understood as inducing a metric on the space of possible state transitions. In related work on variational inference, such metrics arise naturally from precision-weighted prediction errors and define a geometry on belief space. The present framework extends this idea outward: what appears locally as belief-space geometry emerges globally as spacetime geometry, with both encoding the same underlying structure of informational constraint.

### 3.2 Implications for General Relativity

On this view, general relativity is not a fundamental description of spacetime. It is a macroscopic geometric encoding of information-theoretic constraints on causal processes. The metric tensor summarizes, in geometric language, the structure of these constraints.

One might object that this reduces general relativity to an approximation. In a sense, it does. But this is not a deflationary claim. Thermodynamics is also an approximation to statistical mechanics, yet thermodynamics captures genuine features of physical reality. The framework treats general relativity analogously: as a coarse-grained but accurate description of constraint-structure at macroscopic scales.

### 3.3 Discreteness Without Pixelation

A common objection to discrete spacetime is that it creates a "grid" (like a chessboard) with preferred directions, violating Lorentz invariance. This framework avoids that problem by assuming the discreteness is stochastic rather than regular.

Imagine a sheet of paper with dots arranged in a perfect grid. If you rotate the grid, the pattern changes. Now imagine a sheet of paper with dots scattered randomly (a Poisson distribution). If you rotate the random scatter, the statistical distribution remains identical. This framework treats spacetime events like the random dots of a pointillist painting. At the smallest scale, it is discrete. But because the distribution is random, it preserves the smooth symmetries of relativity at large scales. There is no "grid," only a cloud of causal connections.

## 4. The Quantum Wave Function as Epistemic

### 4.1 The Core Proposal

The framework proposes that the quantum wave function is epistemic rather than ontic. The wave function functions as a mathematical representation of coarse-grained information about a system. It does not provide a complete specification of physical reality. In this sense, the quantum state functions as a generative model: it specifies expectations over possible outcomes constrained by the available coarse-grained description, rather than enumerating underlying microstates.

This claim requires careful unpacking. To say the wave function is epistemic is not to say quantum mechanics is merely subjective or observer-dependent in an arbitrary way. The wave function encodes objective constraints on what we can know given the coarse-grained description we have access to.

Physical outcomes become definite when interactions necessitate an update of the effective description. This process is analogous to lazy evaluation in computation: values are not calculated until they are needed. Prior to such interactions, asking "what is the definite value?" is not a question that admits an answer, because no definite value yet exists relative to the coarse-grained description.

This epistemic view faces challenges from no-go theorems, specifically the Pusey-Barrett-Rudolph (PBR) theorem, which argues that distinct quantum states must correspond to distinct physical realities. This framework navigates the PBR constraint by positing that the "hidden variables" are not local state properties but global properties of the causal set *C*. Thus, the wave function represents knowledge of the global constraints, not merely local statistical ignorance.

### 4.2 The Source of Apparent Randomness

If the wave function is epistemic, what generates the apparent randomness of quantum measurement? The framework locates randomness in three sources: unavoidable coarse-graining, contextuality, and the practical inaccessibility of fine-grained degrees of freedom.

At a sufficiently fine-grained level, including the detailed microstates of measuring devices and environments, the underlying dynamics may be treated as deterministic. Apparent quantum randomness arises because we cannot, even in principle, access this level of description from within the system.

One might object that this resembles hidden-variable theories, which Bell's theorem constrains. The framework acknowledges this tension but offers a specific response: the underlying determinism is not factorizable into spacetime-local parts. The next section develops this point.

## 5. Entanglement and Non-Locality

### 5.1 Entanglement as Structural Adjacency

The framework treats entanglement not as a mysterious connection between distant objects, but as a preservation of adjacency in the causal graph. In a network, "distance" is defined by the number of links between nodes, not by metric separation.

Entangled particles share a common ancestor, a single parent interaction. Until they interact with the environment, they remain direct neighbors in the underlying information structure, regardless of how far apart they appear in space. When a measurement occurs, it implies a global update to this graph structure. It resolves the state of the shared link. This update is immediate because the "distance" light must travel is an emergent property of the graph's depth, not a barrier to the graph's own internal logic. The particles affect each other instantly because, in the fundamental graph, they are adjacent.

### 5.2 Navigating Bell’s Theorem and Non-Locality

Bell’s theorem demonstrates that no local hidden-variable theory can reproduce quantum correlations. This framework accepts the violation of Bell inequalities but rejects the conclusion that nature is fundamentally random. Instead, it abandons the assumption of factorizability. This abandonment of factorizability mirrors the logic of variational inference in systems with shared latent causes: correlations arise from common global constraints rather than superluminal influence, while local marginal statistics remain unaffected.

In this view, the underlying determinism is not factorizable into independent, spacetime-local parts. The causal graph allows for structural adjacency (direct links between nodes) that does not map to spatial proximity. Consequently, the system exhibits parameter independence (no superluminal signaling) while violating outcome independence (correlations depend on the global causal structure). Crucially, this dependence does not permit information to travel faster than light. The marginal statistics observed at any single measurement node remain indistinguishable from randomness. An observer can only detect the correlations by comparing local records with distant data, a process constrained by the speed of light. This constitutes a form of non-local realism where the "hidden variables" are topological features of the causal graph rather than localized packets of information.

## 6. Possibility, Actuality, and Information

### 6.1 The Ontological Status of the Substrate

To avoid ambiguity regarding the nature of "information," we must distinguish between the mathematical substrate and physical actuality. Let *Ω* represent the landscape of all mathematically allowed configurations defined by the laws of physics. This space is Platonic, not physical; it functions as the map of possibility.

In contrast, the universe we observe is the specific path, denoted as *γ*, realized through this landscape. The realized path *γ* can be understood as the trajectory that extremizes an informational action over *Ω*, subject to the constraints defining physical law. This distinction clarifies the ontological commitment: the constraints defining *Ω* are mathematical and structural, while the events comprising *γ* are physical and temporal. Information is therefore not a substance existing within the universe. Rather, it is a relational measure of the specificity of *γ* against the background of *Ω*. This resolves the wastefulness problem often associated with many-worlds theories. We do not need to assume that every possible branch of the map physically exists. The map exists as a set of rules, but only the path is rendered into physical existence. Crucially, the map does not push the path. Physicality is simply the state of being part of the active path. The logic of the map is the motion itself, meaning no external force is required to translate abstract rules into physical events.

### 6.2 Information as Relational

Information, on this view, is the measure of specificity. It is a relationship between where the system actually is (the path) and where it could have been (the landscape).

A system has high information content when its actual state is very specific compared to the vast range of options available in the landscape. It has low information content when its state is generic, matching a large portion of the possible options.

### 6.3 Entropy and the Second Law

This distinction allows us to understand entropy not as disorder, but as volume. Entropy measures how much room the system has to move within its current description.

The second law of thermodynamics is not a force pushing the system. It is a statistical tilt created by the geometry of the landscape. There are vastly more "high entropy" states than "low entropy" states. As the system evolves, it naturally falls into these larger regions simply because there are more ways to be there. The arrow of time is the inevitable descent of the specific path into the widest available parts of the possibility landscape.

From this perspective, the second law is not an additional dynamical principle but a geometric fact about the structure of *Ω*. Systems embedded within this landscape must locally minimize informational surprise in order to persist, a requirement formalized by free energy minimization. The global arrow of time and the local imperative of inference are therefore two expressions of the same asymmetry in the possibility space.

## 7. Causal Structure and the Nature of Time

### 7.1 The Ontology of Becoming

Standard physics often assumes a "Block Universe" where the past, present, and future exist simultaneously as a static 4D structure. This framework adopts a "Growing Block" model. The universe is not a finished object; it is a process of active construction.

This process follows a principle of Lazy Evaluation. In computation, a lazy system does not calculate a value until that value is specifically required by another part of the program. Similarly, physical reality does not instantiate the future until an interaction demands it. An "event" is the successful resolution of such a demand. Until that moment, the future exists only as probabilistic potential: a set of rules waiting to be applied, not a territory waiting to be discovered. This process closely parallels active inference, where future states are not explicitly represented but constrained implicitly until action or interaction forces their resolution.

### 7.2 The Mechanism of Local Realization

This model resolves the tension between quantum collapse and relativity by redefining the "trigger" for evaluation. Evaluation is not a global update but a local resolution of causal dependency.

Consider two events, *A* and *B*, where the output of *A* is a necessary input for *B*. In a lazy evaluation context, the specific value of *A* is not computed until the causal horizon of event *B* intersects with *A*. The "collapse" is the establishment of this causal link. This update propagates outward at the speed of causality (light speed), respecting Lorentz invariance. It does not change the entire universe instantly; it only updates the immediate causal neighborhood required to satisfy the dependency of *B*. In this sense, physical interaction plays the same role as action in active inference: it selects which unresolved dependencies must be evaluated in order to maintain local coherence.

### 7.3 The Vacuum as Informational Potential

What determines where the next event occurs? In this view, the "vacuum" is not empty space. It is a dense web of unfulfilled dependencies and potentials.

Gravity and geometry describe the statistical shape of this web. New events do not appear randomly; they appear where the informational "cost" of resolution is minimized. The structure of spacetime is the structure of these waiting potentials, guiding the growth of the universe along the path of least constraint.

## 8. Black Holes and the Limits of Description

The framework has a natural application to black hole physics. The interior of a black hole is not representable by our effective update rules. This reflects a breakdown of the coarse-grained causal description rather than a failure of determinism at the fundamental level.

From the exterior, the black hole interior is informationally inaccessible. The effective description simply does not extend there. In the terminology established in Section 6, the event horizon marks a boundary where the specific path *γ* becomes operationally indistinguishable from the generalized potential of the landscape *Ω* for an external observer. The information defining the interior trajectory is not destroyed; however, it ceases to be part of the accessible causal history relative to the outside. This is analogous to a subroutine that has been called but has not yet returned a value to the main program.

One might object that this fails to resolve the black hole information paradox. The framework does not claim to resolve this paradox. It offers a reconceptualization: the paradox arises from attempting to apply coarse-grained notions beyond their domain of applicability.

## 9. Synthesis and Schematic Logic

### 9.1 Schematic Logic of the Framework

While a complete mathematical formulation exceeds the scope of this interpretive framework, we can outline the schematic logic governing the system.

1. State Space: The universe is defined by a causal set *C*, consisting of discrete events partially ordered by causality.
2. Constraint Function: A variational functional *F*(*C*), analogous to free energy, maps the causal structure to an informational cost representing the volume of excluded possibilities.
3. Update Rule: The transition from a set *C_t* to *C_t+1* is probabilistic but constrained. The probability *P* of a new event *e* occurring is proportional to the minimization of the informational cost, such that *P*(*e*) ∝ *e*^(-*F*(*C* ∪ {*e*})).

We note that this probability distribution is not posited as a fundamental feature of the ontology. Rather, it emerges from coarse-graining over the inaccessible fine structure of the substrate *Ω*.

This schematic illustrates how geometry (curvature) and dynamics (evolution) can emerge from a fundamental rule of information minimization, formalized as a path integral over causal sets.

### 9.2 Synthesis: The Universe as Constrained Computation

Taken together, these considerations suggest that the universe is most naturally described as realizing a computation in both the physical and information-theoretic sense.

**1. Spacetime geometry** encodes informational constraints.

**2. Spatial distance** reflects the cost of propagating causal influence.

**3. Gravity** arises from the statistical tendency of constrained systems toward configurations with more global possibilities.

**4. Quantum states** function as epistemic summaries whose apparent indeterminacy reflects deferred resolution relative to interaction.

**5. Physical law** governs the rule-based evolution of informational states.

**6. Spacetime itself** emerges as a macroscopic representation of constrained computation rather than as a fundamental ontological substrate.

The framework does not claim that the universe is literally a computer in an engineering sense. Terms such as "lazy evaluation" and "update rules" are used here as structural metaphors. They describe the logical architecture of constraint satisfaction and causal ordering, independent of any literal hardware implementation. The claim is that the concepts of information theory provide the most natural vocabulary for describing these fundamental physical relationships.

## 10. Limitations and Open Questions

The framework faces several challenges that warrant explicit acknowledgment.

**1. Predictive content:** The framework is largely interpretive. It reframes existing physics rather than generating novel predictions. Whether it can be developed into a predictively distinct theory remains an open question.

**2. Mathematical formulation:** The framework gestures toward information-theoretic and causal-set formalisms but does not commit to a specific mathematical structure. This is deliberate, as the philosophical claims are intended to be independent of any particular formalization. However, it also means the framework currently lacks the precision required for detailed physical application.

**3. Empirical adequacy:** Entropic approaches to gravity have faced difficulties reproducing the full content of general relativity. The framework inherits these difficulties. Its viability depends on progress in the underlying research programs it draws upon.

**4. The epistemic-ontic boundary:** If the wave function is epistemic, what is the underlying ontic structure it describes? The framework points toward fine-grained microstates that are in principle inaccessible. But this raises questions about whether such states can bear the explanatory weight assigned to them.

These limitations do not refute the framework. They define its current boundaries and indicate directions for further development.

## 11. Empirical Disconfirmation Thresholds

This framework is not merely a philosophical reinterpretation; it makes distinct claims about the physical structure of the universe that stand in tension with the current consensus. As such, it is vulnerable to specific experimental disconfirmation. While a single null result rarely constitutes definitive proof in isolation, the following empirical trends would serve as strong disconfirmation thresholds for the proposal.

### 11.1 The Dark Matter Threshold

The framework posits that dark matter is a signature of entropic spacetime constraints rather than a particulate substance. Consequently, it predicts that direct detection experiments will continue to return null results indefinitely.

**The Test:** Experiments such as LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ) and its planned successor, XLZD, probe the cross-sections for Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs).

**The Disconfirmation:** While it is difficult to prove a negative, a distinct, positive detection of a dark matter particle that accounts for the majority of the observed missing mass would refute the entropic gravity hypothesis. The framework relies on the persistence of null results in the particle sector combined with geometric explanations in the gravitational sector.

### 11.2 The Geometric Bet: Modified Lensing in Low-Acceleration Regimes

If gravity is entropic, the extra gravity attributed to dark matter should correlate strictly with the surface mass density of baryonic matter (following the Mass-Discrepancy Acceleration Relation) rather than following the free-form distribution allowed by Cold Dark Matter halos.

**The Test:** The Euclid Space Telescope (launched 2023) is currently mapping the geometry of the dark universe via weak gravitational lensing.

**The Kill Vector:** If Euclid’s lensing maps reveal dark matter structures that are dynamically decoupled from baryonic matter, such as dark cores in galaxy clusters that do not align with entropic predictions, the constraint-based model of gravity fails. The framework demands that the dark geometry remains slave to the baryonic information density.

### 11.3 The Discreteness Bet: Lorentz Invariance Preservation

The framework relies on a sprinkled Causal Set structure to preserve Lorentz invariance while maintaining discreteness (Section 3.3). This predicts that spacetime is discrete but effectively smooth to high-energy photons.

**The Test:** The Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope and neutrino observatories like IceCube search for energy-dependent variations in the speed of light (Lorentz Invariance Violation), which would suggest a grid-like spacetime structure.

**The Kill Vector:** If these observatories detect a systematic delay in high-energy photons relative to low-energy photons, it implies a crystalline or grid-like discreteness. This would refute the stochastic sprinkling hypothesis required by this framework to maintain relativity.

### 11.4 The Epistemic Bet: Violation of Local Friendliness

The framework asserts that the wave function represents knowledge or constraints rather than an ontic physical fluid, and that facts are relative to the causal history of the observer (Section 4).

**The Test:** Extended Wigner’s Friend experiments (such as those based on the Bong et al. 2020 local friendliness inequalities) test whether observed events are absolute.

**The Kill Vector:** These experiments compel a choice between the absoluteness of observed events and locality. This framework survives only if absoluteness is violated and facts are relative. If future experiments or stronger no-go theorems prove that local hidden variables (even relative ones) are mathematically impossible without breaking the causal structure itself, the lazy evaluation mechanism would be rendered incoherent.

### 11.5 Summary of Predictions

To summarize, this framework predicts a universe that is:

1. **Particle-poor:** No WIMPs or Axions will be found.
2. **Geometry-rich:** Lensing anomalies will strictly track baryonic mass distributions.
3. **Smooth-yet-discrete:** No Lorentz violation will be detected at the Planck scale.
4. **Relational:** Quantum experiments will continue to violate inequalities that assume absolute, observer-independent facts.

Failure on any one of these fronts would necessitate the abandonment or radical revision of the framework.

## 12. Conclusion

The search for a unified theory of physics has traditionally operated under the assumption that gravity must be quantized to fit the standard model of particle physics. This framework proposes the inverse approach: that quantum mechanics and spacetime geometry are not separate domains to be stitched together, but emergent features of a deeper, substrate-level logic.

Taken together, these considerations suggest that the universe is most naturally described as realizing a computation in both the physical and information-theoretic sense. Spacetime geometry encodes informational constraints, spatial distance reflects the cost of propagating causal influence, and quantum states function as epistemic summaries whose apparent indeterminacy reflects deferred resolution relative to interaction. Physical law governs the rule-based evolution of informational states, while spacetime itself emerges as a macroscopic representation of constrained computation rather than as a fundamental ontological substrate.

This shift in perspective, from a mechanical ontology of objects to a computational ontology of processes, offers resolution to some of the most persistent paradoxes in physics. By distinguishing between the landscape of possibility (the map) and the path of actuality (the territory), we avoid the ontological excess of the many worlds interpretation while retaining its mathematical elegance. By framing entropy as a property of this landscape's geometry, we explain the arrow of time and the nature of gravity without positing new fundamental forces or dark particles.

Furthermore, the principle of lazy evaluation provides a coherent mechanism for the transition from quantum potentiality to classical actuality. It suggests that the non-locality of entanglement and the apparent randomness of measurement are not fundamental anomalies, but efficiency features of a system that instantiates information only when causal adjacency necessitates it.

As outlined in the previous section, this framework is not a metaphysical sanctuary immune to testing. It stands on the precarious ground of specific, falsifiable predictions regarding the nature of the dark sector, the smoothness of spacetime, and the limits of observer-independent facts. Whether this specific formulation proves correct in its details is a matter for future experiment. However, the conceptual core, that the universe follows an informational rather than mechanical logic, provides a fertile new ground for understanding the fundamental nature of existence.
