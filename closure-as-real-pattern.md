# Closure as Real Pattern: Stipulated and Induced Autonomy Across Abstracta, Emergence, and Social Kinds

## Abstract

Debates about real patterns often stall because three questions are treated as one: what exists, what is implemented, and what is represented. This paper argues that a large share of disagreement in metaphysics and philosophy of science is generated by that conflation. I propose a unified framework built around one notion of closure and two sources of closure. The single notion is autonomy of level-specific transitions, what follows at a level is fixed by the level-state for the relevant predictive and interventional task. The two sources are stipulated closure, where constraints are fixed by constitutive rules, and induced closure, where constraints are discovered through stable screening-off in world dynamics. This distinction clarifies the ontology of abstract structures, emergent macro-objects, and social kinds without collapsing them into one category. It also resolves familiar puzzles, such as whether chess exists if no one is currently playing it, and whether implementation dependence in law or language implies unreality. The aim is conceptual clarification with formal discipline, not an empirical proof strategy (Dennett 1991; Shalizi and Crutchfield 2001; Rosas et al. 2024).

## 1. Introduction: Why Real-Pattern Debates Keep Stalling

Real-pattern debates are often framed as a choice between two extremes. On one side, patterns are treated as useful summaries with no ontological weight. On the other side, patterns are treated as entities that compete with lower-level physical description for metaphysical priority. The result is repetitive disagreement.

The central diagnosis is equivocation. Authors shift between claims about structure, implementation, and cognition without marking the shift. Critics then reject claims that were not actually made, and defenders overstate claims they cannot support.

Closure-based work already gives us a better starting point. In computational mechanics and related approaches, autonomy at a level is diagnosed by whether lower-level detail improves prediction or intervention for that level's future (Shalizi and Crutchfield 2001; Rosas et al. 2024). Yet closure language is still used in two ways that are rarely separated. In some contexts, closure is rule-internal consequence, as in formal systems. In others, closure is discovered screening-off in dynamics, as in physical emergence.

This paper makes one claim and one distinction.

First, there is one closure concept: autonomy of what follows at a level.

Second, closure enters from two sources: stipulated and induced.

The argument proceeds in five steps. Section 2 introduces a minimal ontology ladder. Section 3 defines closure once and fixes its modal role. Section 4 distinguishes stipulated from induced closure while preserving one definition. Section 5 separates implementation from representation. Section 6 applies the framework to conceptual illustrations from mathematics, emergence, and social ontology. Sections 7 and 8 diagnose recurring failures in the literature and answer standard objections.

## 2. A Minimal Ontology Ladder: Reality, Patterns, Representations

### 2.1 Reality

Reality is the ongoing causal process that does not depend on our descriptions. This is a minimal realism claim. It does not presuppose a final privileged inventory of entities. It only states that the world is not constituted by our models of it.

### 2.2 Patterns

Patterns are stable dependency structures in reality. They include transition structures, invariances, and constraint relations that support counterfactual reasoning. A pattern is not just a label. It is what makes some interventions and forecasts succeed while others fail.

### 2.3 Representations

Representations are cognitive or symbolic encodings of patterns. They are evaluable for adequacy. They can be partial, biased, or wrong. This fallibility is exactly why representation must not be identified with pattern.

### 2.4 Why this ladder matters

The ladder blocks two recurrent errors.

First, non-representation does not imply non-existence.

Second, implementation dependence does not imply subjectivity.

Keeping these points explicit prevents many pseudo-disputes before they start.

## 3. Closure: One Core Concept

### 3.1 Closure as autonomy of what follows

A level description is closed when, given the level-state, what follows at that level is fixed without importing lower-level distinctions that improve level-targeted prediction or intervention.

This definition allows deterministic and probabilistic dynamics. What matters is not determinism. What matters is explanatory and interventional sufficiency at the level under evaluation.

### 3.2 A minimal formal template

Let $X_t$ denote microstate history and $Z_t = g(X_t)$ a candidate level description. Closure for $Z$ concerns whether the transition structure over $Z$-states is autonomous for the target horizon and intervention class. In information-theoretic terms, the induced case can be tested by whether additional microhistory fails to improve prediction of future $Z$ once past $Z$ is known, and by whether macro-interventions suffice for macro-control in the relevant class (Rosas et al. 2024).

The formal template is diagnostic, not constitutive. It identifies when closure is present. It does not define reality as prediction.

### 3.3 Closure and modal structure

Closure gives a level its own modal profile. Once closure holds, we can ask meaningful level-specific counterfactuals without rederiving the entire microstory each time. That is the basis of non-fundamental but objective object talk.

## 4. Two Sources of Closure

### 4.1 Stipulated closure: rule-defined autonomy

In stipulated cases, closure is fixed by constitutive constraints. Chess, arithmetic, and formal proof systems are paradigms. Once rules are set, valid transitions and consequences are fixed relative to those rules.

This does not require heavy Platonism. The claim is modest and structural. Rule-governed consequence is objective relative to fixed constraints, even if historical communities were needed to formulate and transmit those constraints.

Stipulated closure supports a precise distinction between structure and enactment. A system can be currently unimplemented and still have a determinate consequence structure.

### 4.2 Induced closure: dynamics-defined autonomy

In induced cases, closure is discovered by examining world dynamics. A coarse-graining earns autonomy when it screens off microdetail for macro-futures under relevant perturbations. Here the closure claim is empirical in method, though not reducible to convenience.

The $\varepsilon$-machine/$\upsilon$-machine relation provides one operational route to this diagnosis (Shalizi and Crutchfield 2001; Rosas et al. 2024). Strong lumpability provides a sufficient condition for robust closure in key Markov settings.

Two qualifications matter for reviewer resilience.

First, induced closure is usually regime-relative. Timescale and intervention class must be explicit.

Second, token-level failure does not automatically defeat type-level autonomy. Demanding perfect closure for every token would discard most scientifically indispensable macro-kinds.

### 4.3 Limiting-case relation

The two sources differ in provenance, not in closure's meaning. At the limit of perfect induced closure, the resulting transition structure plays the same formal role as a stipulated rule system. One is discovered from dynamics. The other is fixed by explicit constraints. Both instantiate autonomy of what follows.

## 5. Implementation and Representation: Distinct Roles

### 5.1 Implementation

Implementation answers, where is this pattern running now, and in what substrate.

Patterns can be implemented in wood, silicon, neural tissue, fluid media, or institutions. This is a claim about realization, not a claim about whether the pattern has a determinate structure.

For stipulated systems, implementation is required for enactment, not for structural existence. For induced systems, implementation conditions are usually constitutive of token existence because the pattern was identified from concrete dynamics.

### 5.2 Representation

Representation answers, how is the pattern modeled by an agent or symbol system.

A weather model is not a storm. A legal brief is not the legal order. A player's concept of chess is not chess. Each representation can be tested for fit, scope, and distortion.

### 5.3 A diagnostic triad

For disputed cases, ask three ordered questions.

1. What is the pattern structure?
2. What are its implementation conditions?
3. Which representations are in play, and where can they fail?

Most category mistakes in ontology can be traced to skipping one of these questions.

## 6. Conceptual Illustrations

### 6.1 Chess

Chess gives a clean stipulated case.

The structure is a rule-defined transition system. Implementations include board play and digital execution. Representations include notation, strategy manuals, and players' internal models.

If all current players disappeared, implementations and representations would disappear. The rule-defined structure would remain definable. That is enough for structural realism about chess without treating chess as a physical force.

### 6.2 Mathematics and logic

Mathematics intensifies the same point. It is historically developed but not freely configurable after axioms are fixed. This position avoids two unstable extremes, naive formal arbitrariness and ontologically inflated realm talk.

The triad helps again. Mathematical structure, mathematical practice, and mathematical cognition are distinct layers. Collapsing them generates most familiar confusion in this literature.

### 6.3 Hurricanes and organisms

These are induced-closure cases.

Macrovariables can be intervention-relevant and predictively sufficient while screening off most microdetail for domain-relevant futures. This is exactly the kind of autonomy closure frameworks were built to capture.

The right target is robust type-level closure across the relevant perturbation class. Local token failure under unusual boundary violations does not undermine the reality of the pattern type.

### 6.4 English and law

Social kinds are mixed-source cases.

Law includes stipulated constraints and induced enforcement dynamics. Language includes codified norms and dynamically stabilized usage. Their dependence on institutions and interpreters does not make them unreal. It specifies the conditions under which their causal profile is active.

This point is often misstated as relativism. A better description is conditional realism: once sustaining implementations are in place, norm-governed constraints generate objective consequences inside the domain.

## 7. Where Debates Commonly Go Wrong

### 7.1 Abstracta debates

Frequent mistake: infer non-reality from non-implementation.

Correction: distinguish structural determinacy from historical enactment.

### 7.2 Emergence debates

Frequent mistake: treat induced closure as mere convenience.

Correction: closure concerns screening-off and intervention-guiding autonomy, not only compact description (Woodward 2003).

### 7.3 Social ontology debates

Frequent mistake: infer anti-realism from normative dependence.

Correction: norm-governed constraints can be objectively action-guiding when implementation conditions are met.

## 8. Objections and Replies

### 8.1 "This is instrumentalism with different vocabulary"

Reply: the framework does not identify reality with usefulness. It identifies a structural condition, autonomy of transitions, that can be tested by predictive and interventional diagnostics. Usefulness may track closure, but usefulness alone does not establish closure.

### 8.2 "Stipulated closure is mind-dependent, so it is not real"

Reply: genesis and validity must be separated. Historical uptake can be mind-dependent while consequence structure remains objective relative to fixed constraints. Mind dependence of origin does not imply arbitrariness of what follows.

### 8.3 "You are equivocating on closure"

Reply: closure is defined once. The distinction is source-based, not meaning-based. If critics reject the definition itself, that is a substantive disagreement and should be argued directly.

### 8.4 "The view is too broad to constrain"

Reply: constraints are source-specific and explicit. Stipulated claims must show rule-governed consequence. Induced claims must show screening-off and intervention-guiding autonomy. Mixed social claims must satisfy both where both are invoked.

### 8.5 "Approximate closure makes realism interest-relative"

Reply: approximation requires explicit specification of regime, timescale, and intervention class. That dependence is methodological, not arbitrary. It mirrors ordinary scientific practice in which objectivity is secured by publicly assessable standards, not by context-free absolutes.

## 9. Conclusion

The paper's core claim is simple and, I argue, stabilizing. Closure is one concept with two sources.

This yields three payoffs.

First, it separates pattern from representation and blocks recurrent category errors.

Second, it separates structure from implementation and clarifies persistence, absence, and dependence claims.

Third, it permits realism across abstracta, emergent wholes, and social kinds without reductionist flattening or metaphysical inflation.

The framework is meant as a clarification tool. In each dispute, it asks the same ordered questions: what is the closure claim, what is its source, and what dependence profile follows from that source.

## Optional Appendix Sketch

If needed for technically oriented reviewers, a short appendix can include a toy Markov example with two coarse-grainings. One coarse-graining is strongly lumpable and supports induced closure. The other fails because macro-futures remain history-dependent after coarse-graining. The appendix would be explicitly illustrative and subordinate to the philosophical argument.
