# Closure as Real Pattern: Stipulated and Induced Autonomy Across Abstracta, Emergence, and Social Kinds

## Abstract

Debates about real patterns often stall because different questions are treated as one. Authors move between ontology, implementation, and cognition without marking the shift, then disagree about claims that were never equivalent. This paper proposes a unifying fix. Closure should be understood as one concept, the autonomy of what follows at a given level. However, closure enters inquiry through two distinct sources. In stipulated closure, transition constraints are fixed by rules, as in chess or arithmetic. In induced closure, transition constraints are discovered through stable screening-off in world dynamics, as in storms, cells, or some institutional processes. Distinguishing source while preserving one closure concept clarifies what is real in each case and blocks a common equivocation in both metaphysics and philosophy of science. The framework also separates patterns from their implementations and from representations of them. This distinction resolves familiar puzzles, including whether abstract structures exist without current instances, and whether implementation-dependence in social kinds implies unreality. The result is a single, non-mystical framework for realism across abstracta, emergent wholes, and norm-governed social domains (Dennett 1991; Shalizi and Crutchfield 2001; Rosas et al. 2024).

## 1. Introduction: Why Real-Pattern Debates Keep Stalling

Arguments about real patterns repeatedly collapse under a predictable pressure. One side treats patterns as nothing more than useful summaries. The other treats them as full ontological rivals to microphysics. Both sides then accuse the other of category error, and both are often partly correct.

The pressure comes from equivocation. At least three distinct issues are usually blended: what exists, what is currently implemented, and what is represented by a thinker or model. Once these are separated, many disputes become tractable.

Closure-based approaches already provide a strong starting point. In computational mechanics and related work, a level is autonomous when lower-level detail does not improve prediction or control of that level's future (Shalizi and Crutchfield 2001; Rosas et al. 2024). The risk is not in the concept itself, but in its use. Closure is sometimes treated as if it had one meaning in formal systems and another in physical emergence, with no explicit bridge.

This paper argues that there is one closure notion and two sources. The one notion is autonomy of level-specific transitions: given the state at that level, what follows at that level is fixed well enough for the domain in question. The two sources are stipulated and induced. Stipulated closure is fixed by explicit rules. Induced closure is discovered through robust screening-off in dynamics.

The contribution is conceptual rather than empirical. The aim is to provide a framework that prevents equivocation across three target domains: abstracta, emergent physical wholes, and social kinds. Examples throughout are conceptual illustrations, not evidential case studies.

## 2. A Minimal Ontology Ladder: Reality, Patterns, Representations

### 2.1 Reality

Reality is the ongoing causal process that does not depend on our descriptions. This claim is modest. It does not assume a final metaphysical inventory. It only marks that the world is not constituted by our theories of it.

### 2.2 Patterns

Patterns are stable dependency structures in reality, including transition structures over states. They are not reducible to current human representation. They can be tracked well or badly, and they can be implemented in different substrates. A pattern is what makes certain counterfactual claims true and others false under relevant constraints.

### 2.3 Representations

Representations are cognitive or symbolic encodings of patterns. They can be partial, distorted, or false. Their fallibility is precisely why pattern and representation must be distinguished. If these are identified, error becomes unintelligible.

### 2.4 Why this ladder matters

The ladder blocks two common mistakes. First, it blocks the inference from "not currently represented" to "not real." Second, it blocks the inference from "implemented in social or cognitive practice" to "merely subjective." The paper's later claims rely on this separation.

## 3. Closure: One Core Concept

### 3.1 Closure as autonomy of what follows

A level is closed when, given the level-state, what follows at that level is determined without importing lower-level distinctions that improve level-targeted prediction or intervention.

This can be deterministic or probabilistic. The key point is modal. Closure defines which transitions are possible, impossible, or robustly expected within the level's own state space.

### 3.2 Closure and modal structure

Once closure is secured, a level has its own counterfactual profile. We can ask "what would happen if this macro-variable changed" and get stable answers without rederiving everything from microdetail each time. This is what licenses object-level talk in non-fundamental domains.

In formal settings, this modal structure appears as rule-governed consequence. In physical settings, it appears as stable transition kernels over a coarse-graining. The form is shared even when provenance differs.

### 3.3 One shape, two sources

The unifying claim is strict. Closure means the same thing in both settings. What differs is how closure is fixed. In one case it is fixed by stipulation. In the other it is fixed by discovered world structure.

## 4. Two Ways Closure Enters

### 4.1 Stipulated closure: rule-defined autonomy

Chess and arithmetic are clear cases. Once constitutive rules are fixed, legal transitions and valid consequences are fixed relative to that system. The structure can be studied independently of any current token play.

This does not require Platonist inflation. The claim is not that abstract structures are extra causal substances. The claim is that rule-defined transition structures are objective relative to their constitutive constraints. Implementation is needed for enactment, not for structural determinacy.

### 4.2 Induced closure: dynamics-defined autonomy

Hurricanes, organisms, and other macro-processes exhibit closure when a coarse-graining screens off microdetail for the macro-future under relevant perturbations. Here closure is inferred from successful autonomy tests, not declared by fiat.

The Rosas framework gives one operational route: compare predictive and interventional sufficiency at macro and micro histories through the relation between $\varepsilon$- and $\upsilon$-machines (Rosas et al. 2024; Shalizi and Crutchfield 2001). Strong lumpability gives a sufficient condition in key classes of Markov systems.

Induced closure is often approximate across wide regimes and exact in narrower ones. That does not make it arbitrary. It means closure is assessed relative to explicit timescales, intervention classes, and tolerances that are themselves open to public scrutiny.

### 4.3 Limiting-case connection

At the limit of perfect induced closure, the resulting autonomous transition structure has the same formal role as a stipulated rule-system. What differs is genealogy. One is specified first and then implemented. The other is implemented first and then abstracted.

## 5. Implementation and Representation: Distinct Roles

### 5.1 Implementation

A pattern can be implemented in many substrates, wood, silicon, neurons, fluid media, legal institutions. Implementation answers a specific question: where is this pattern currently running? It does not answer whether the pattern has a determinate structure.

For stipulated systems, non-implementation means inactivity, not non-existence of the rule-structure. For induced systems, non-implementation usually means the process is absent because the closure was world-discovered in the first place.

### 5.2 Representation

Representation is a separate layer. My concept of chess is not chess. A weather model is not a hurricane. A legal interpretation is not the full legal order. Each representation can be assessed by how well it tracks the relevant pattern and by where it fails.

### 5.3 A triad for diagnosis

For any disputed entity, ask three questions in order. First, what is the pattern structure? Second, where and how is it implemented? Third, which representations are being used, and with what distortions? Many ontological disputes dissolve once these questions are kept separate.

## 6. Conceptual Illustrations

### 6.1 Chess

Chess clarifies stipulated closure. The rule-structure fixes legal move transitions and terminal conditions. Implementations include boards, software, and neural activity in players. Representations include textbooks, engine evaluations, and a novice's understanding.

If all players vanished, implementations and representations would vanish. The rule-defined transition structure would remain definable. This is enough for structural realism about chess without treating chess as a physical force.

### 6.2 Mathematics and logic

Mathematics is a stronger stipulated case. It is invented in one sense, because humans formulate axiom systems, but not freely invented, because inferential consequences are constrained once axioms are fixed. This middle position avoids naive formal arbitrariness and avoids a metaphysically heavy separate realm.

The key distinction is again triadic. Mathematical structure, mathematical practice, and mathematical cognition should not be conflated.

### 6.3 Hurricanes and organisms

These illustrate induced closure. Macro-variables can support intervention and prediction while screening off most microdetail for domain-relevant forecasts. Closure here is graded and regime-sensitive. Local failure under unusual perturbation does not erase pattern reality at the type level.

This point blocks a common objection. Requiring token-level perfection would eliminate most scientifically indispensable objects.

### 6.4 English and law

Social kinds often combine both sources. Law includes stipulated rules and induced enforcement dynamics. English includes codified constraints and dynamically stabilized usage. Their implementation dependence does not imply unreality. It specifies the conditions under which their causal profile exists.

The mistake is to treat implementation dependence as evidence of fictionality. A better conclusion is conditional ontology: these patterns are real when and because the sustaining implementations are in place.

## 7. Where Debates Go Wrong

First, abstracta debates often infer non-reality from non-implementation. That moves too quickly from one layer to another.

Second, emergence debates often confuse induced closure with mere model convenience. Autonomy is not equivalent to convenience. It concerns screening-off and interventional stability under explicit conditions (Woodward 2003).

Third, social ontology debates often treat norm-governed dependence as anti-realist. This ignores the way constraint systems can generate objective consequences once institutional implementations are active.

## 8. Objections and Replies

### 8.1 "This is instrumentalism in new language"

No. Instrumentalism says model success can remain detached from ontology. The present framework links realism claims to closure conditions that concern counterfactual structure, not convenience alone. Model choice can vary, but closure success or failure is not purely preference-sensitive.

### 8.2 "Stipulated closure is mind-dependent"

The objection is partly right and partly misdirected. Stipulated systems require historical acts of rule-fixing and communities of uptake. But once fixed, their consequence structure is objective relative to those constraints. Mind dependence of genesis does not imply arbitrariness of consequence.

### 8.3 "You still equivocate on closure"

The equivocation charge should be settled by the architecture itself. Closure is defined once, autonomy of transitions. The two-way distinction concerns provenance, not meaning. If critics propose a different closure definition, that becomes a direct substantive disagreement rather than a hidden shift.

### 8.4 "The framework is too broad to constrain"

Breadth is a risk. The constraint comes from the triad and from source-specific standards. Stipulated closure is tested by rule-governed consequence. Induced closure is tested by screening-off and interventional stability. Social cases must satisfy both where both are claimed.

## 9. Conclusion

The paper's central claim is simple. Closure is one concept with two sources. This clarifies realism claims without collapsing abstract structures, emergent processes, and social kinds into one ontological type.

The framework yields three practical gains. It distinguishes pattern from representation, preventing familiar category mistakes. It distinguishes structure from implementation, resolving disputes about absence, persistence, and dependence. And it gives a stable vocabulary for cross-domain realism that is neither reductionist nor mystical.

Future work can formalize the induced side further through short toy models of successful and failed coarse-grainings. That extension should remain subordinate to the conceptual argument developed here.
