## Your Synthesis Unpacked

Your formulation—**"Truth is invariance within viable structures, discovered through pragmatic filtering of failures"**—does something that each of these traditions does partially but none does completely. Let me break down how.

### The Three Components

**1. "Invariance"** — from structural realism

Hermann Weyl asserted that "the mathematical idea of invariance is taken to characterise the notion of objectivity"—we obtain agreement by giving objective status only to those relations that are invariant under particular transformations. This is the core insight of structural realism: what's *real* about our theories isn't the objects they posit (ether, phlogiston, caloric) but the *structural relations* that survive theory change.

Ladyman and French's ontic structural realism (OSR) pushes this further: According to OSR, even the identity and individuality of objects depends on the relational structure of the world. Their book *Every Thing Must Go* argues that metaphysicians must abandon the picture of the world as composed of self-subsistent individual objects—structure is ontologically fundamental.

**2. "Viable structures"** — from evolutionary epistemology + pragmatism

This adds a crucial constraint the pure structuralists often leave implicit. Not all structures are equal—only *viable* ones matter. In Popperian evolutionary epistemology, bold conjectures are made about the outer world, and if these hypotheses are not falsified, they survive. In the long run, unfit theories are eliminated by the process of falsification.

Rescher's methodological pragmatism provides the evaluative frame: In Rescher's view, the truth of a statement does not derive from the statement's utility as such, but from the fact that the statement coheres with a set of beliefs whose epistemic reliability has been established by a method with proven utility. Truth isn't "what works" (crude pragmatism)—it's what emerges from *methods* that work.

**3. "Pragmatic filtering of failures"** — the Popperian-Campbellian mechanism

This is the *how*: Campbell described evolutionary epistemology as "a process that progresses by trial and error-elimination, creating new hypotheses and selectively eliminating false ones." Knowledge grows not by positive verification but by negative selection—failures are filtered out.

## What Makes Your Synthesis Distinctive

**Standard realism** says: Truth is correspondence between propositions and objects.
*Problem*: Objects keep changing across theory revolutions (ether → electromagnetic field).

**Structural realism** says: Truth is correspondence between theoretical structures and the structure of reality.
*Problem*: Which structures? How do we know we've got the right ones?

**Crude pragmatism** says: Truth is what works.
*Problem*: Many false things "work" locally; utility isn't truth.

**Popperian fallibilism** says: Truth is what survives refutation attempts.
*Problem*: Survival is necessary but not sufficient—many unfalsified theories are trivial or merely lucky.

**Your synthesis** says: Truth is what remains *structurally invariant* across the *viable* frameworks that survive *pragmatic selection pressure*.

This triangulates: structure provides the *form* of truth, viability provides the *constraint*, and failure-filtering provides the *discovery mechanism*.

## The Key Interlocutors

### Nicholas Rescher (1928–2024)

Rescher's "methodological pragmatism" is perhaps closest to your position. In his system of pragmatic idealism, the activity of the human mind makes a fundamental contribution to knowledge, while "valid" knowledge contributes to practical success. Rescher also defends a coherence theory of truth in a manner differing from classical idealism.

Critically, Rescher's is a scientific pragmatism, centered on the notions of method, success, and evolution, in which no room is left for doubt about the possibility of achieving sound knowledge of reality. He distinguishes "pragmatism of the right" (objective, truth-seeking) from "pragmatism of the left" (Rorty-style relativism), firmly siding with the former.

However, Rescher doesn't foreground *invariance* as the form truth takes—that's where your synthesis goes beyond him.

### Susan Haack

Haack argues that foundationalism and coherentism do not exhaust the field, and that an intermediate theory—foundherentism—is more plausible than either. It includes the relevance of experience for justification while allowing for pervasive mutual dependence among beliefs.

Her crossword puzzle analogy captures something like structural coherence: individual entries constrain each other, and the whole grid either works or doesn't. But Haack's focus is justification (how we're *warranted* in believing), not the nature of truth itself.

### Ladyman, French, and OSR

Ontic structural realism (OSR), as developed by French and Ladyman, incorporates an explicit commitment to the claim that the world has an objective modal structure and that this structure is represented by the theoretical structure of our best scientific theories.

OSR provides your metaphysics of structure. But OSR is typically presented as a position about *what exists* (structures, not objects), not as an account of *how we discover truth*. Your formulation adds the epistemological mechanism.

### Peirce's Fallibilism and Convergence

Peirce offers a precursor: The structure of reality seems to offer us convergence: a convergence into fewer answers to multiple questions that are raised by genuine doubts. Genuine doubts are settled by beliefs that turn out to be indefeasible—that gravitate toward relevant and continuous evidence.

Although the scientific method will eventually converge to something as a limit, nevertheless at any temporal point in the process of scientific inquiry we are only at a provisional stage of it and cannot ascertain how far off we may be from the limit to which we are somehow converging.

Peirce's "truth as the limit of inquiry" anticipates your filtering mechanism, though he didn't emphasize structural invariance specifically.

## Related Ideas Worth Exploring

**1. Weyl's "Invariance = Objectivity"**
Weyl's philosophy of physics directly grounds objectivity in invariance under transformations. Your formulation applies this beyond physics to epistemology generally.

**2. Rescher's "Methodological Pragmatism" (1977)**
His book of this title develops a systems-theoretic approach to knowledge that emphasizes method over content—close to your "pragmatic filtering."

**3. Structural Continuity in Theory Change**
The task of providing an adequate theory of approximate truth that fits the history of science has defeated realists, but a much more tractable problem is to display the structural commonalities between different theories. Hence, a form of realism committed only to the structure of theories might not be undermined by theory change.

**4. Campbell's "Blind Variation and Selective Retention" (BVSR)**
Campbell applied the BVSR principle to the evolution of knowledge, founding evolutionary epistemology as a generalization of Popper's philosophy of science, which conceives the development of new theories as proposing conjectures (blind variation) followed by refutation (selective elimination).

## Where to Take This

Your formulation suggests a research program:

1. **Characterize "viability"** more precisely—what makes a structure viable? (Coherence? Predictive success? Explanatory unification?)

2. **Specify the invariance conditions**—invariance under *what* transformations? (Change of theoretical vocabulary? Change of representational framework? Change of observer perspective?)

3. **Articulate the filtering mechanism**—is it purely negative (elimination of failures), or does it include positive selection (amplification of successes)?

4. **Address the bootstrapping problem**—the structures we use to identify invariants are themselves subject to revision. How does the process get started?

The thinkers who'd engage most directly: Ladyman on structure, Rescher on pragmatic method, Haack on the interplay of coherence and experience, and contemporary Peirceans like Cheryl Misak on truth as the aim of inquiry.
