Why did germ theory replace miasma theory? While a standard answer points to superior evidence, a deeper analysis reveals a story about systemic viability. Although miasma theory’s focus on sanitation had some positive public health effects, its core principles were degenerating. The miasma network was demonstrably brittle; it generated catastrophic real-world costs—thousands died in London because public health efforts were misdirected at odors—and it required an accelerating number of ad hoc "patches" to explain anomalies, such as why the "bad air" was only deadly near a specific water pump. The germ theory network, by contrast, proved to be a vastly more resilient and adaptive solution. It dramatically reduced these costs by enabling effective interventions and explained a wide range of phenomena with a single, powerful conceptual tool.

This historical dynamic highlights a persistent challenge for contemporary coherentist theories of justification: the isolation objection. As Laurence BonJour (1985) acknowledged, a belief system could achieve perfect internal coherence while remaining entirely detached from reality. While coherentists have developed various responses to this objection (Olsson 2005; Kvanvig 2012), most rely on internalist resources that fail to provide the external constraint coherentism requires. Scholars have made compelling cases for a more structured, asymmetrical web of belief from within Quine's own framework (e.g., Carlson 2015), but the question of what external pressures forge this structure remains. This paper develops an alternative response that grounds coherence in the demonstrated viability of entire knowledge systems, measured through their historical capacity to minimize what we will term "systemic costs." Drawing inspiration from resilience theory in systems ecology (Holling 1973), this perspective explains how the holistic revisions individuals make to their personal webs of belief in response to recalcitrant experiences—a process we generalize as pragmatic pushback—drive the bottom-up formation of more viable, less fragile public knowledge systems.

This paper models inquiry as an evolutionary process aimed at cultivating viable, less fragile public knowledge systems. It is a macro-epistemology, a theory about the long-term viability of cumulative systems like science and law. The model proposes a Lamarckian-style mechanism of directed adaptation through learning, rather than purely Darwinian selection, to account for the intentional nature of inquiry. To pre-empt a common misinterpretation, we distinguish viability from mere endurance. A brutal empire that persists through coercion is not a viable system in these terms, but a textbook case of a high-brittleness one; its longevity is a measure of the immense energy it wastes suppressing its own instability. Viability is therefore not an intrinsic property but a relational one: a system’s capacity to solve problems within a given pragmatic environment with sustainably low systemic costs.

## **2. A Framework for Assessing Systemic Viability**

To understand how some knowledge systems evolve and thrive while others stagnate and collapse, we need a way to assess their structural health. A naturalistic theory requires functional, precise tools for this analysis, moving beyond mere internal consistency to gauge a system's resilience against real-world pressures. In this, our approach shares a deep affinity with the diagnostic ethos of complex systems theory (Meadows 2008). This section develops such a framework by tracing how a private belief becomes a public, functional component of a knowledge system.

The framework for assessing brittleness is general, but its application reveals two primary modalities of failure, corresponding to the different kinds of pragmatic constraints a network can violate. This distinction clarifies how our approach unifies descriptive and normative inquiry under a single explanatory mechanism.

* **Epistemic Brittleness:** This is the modality of failure resulting from a misalignment with the **causal structure of the world**. It is found in descriptive knowledge systems, like scientific paradigms, whose primary function is to predict and manipulate physical reality. It is diagnosed through indicators of failed causal engagement: an accelerating rate of ad-hoc modification to explain away predictive failures, increasing model complexity without a corresponding increase in causal power, and high energetic inefficiency. The late-stage Ptolemaic network, accumulating epicycles to manage its failed causal predictions, is the canonical example of a system suffering from acute epistemic brittleness.
* **Normative Brittleness:** This is the modality of failure resulting from a misalignment with the emergent normative structure of the world. It is found in socio-political and ethical networks whose primary function is to organize cooperative human action. The specific mechanism for this failure can be precisely articulated through a theory of emergent moral properties. Drawing on Baysan’s (2025) account of emergent moral non-naturalism, we can understand objective moral properties as conferring *noncausal powers*. While a causal power manifests as a physical change, a noncausal power manifests as the obtaining of a normative fact. For example, the property of *being unjust* confers on an institution the noncausal power to *justify resentment* and *require condemnation*. A network's alignment with this structure is not optional. A society predicated on slavery, for instance, exhibits profound normative brittleness because it must expend immense real-world energy to counteract these noncausal powers. The immense coercive overheads required to maintain the institution are the direct, measurable, and *causal* signature of a system struggling to suppress the real normative fact that its core practices justify resistance. This account requires that we move beyond what Bennett-Hunter (2015) calls the 'causalist assumption'—the dictum that 'to be real is to have causal power'—and recognize that a causal vocabulary may not be appropriate for every explanatory domain (El-Hani and Pihlström 2002). This macro-level diagnosis finds a plausible correlate in agent-level moral psychology, where moral intuitions can be understood as evolved detectors for such "response-invoking" features of our environment (Rottschaefer 2012) that signal potential systemic costs if ignored, a direct experience of what Peter (2024) calls the "demands of fittingness."

The central claim of this model is that these two modalities are not fundamentally different kinds of error, but failures to align with different layers of reality. Both are symptoms of the same underlying condition: a misalignment between a network's core principles and the pragmatic constraints of the world. Whether the result is an epicycle or a secret police force, the underlying logic is the same: a brittle system must pay an ever-increasing price to insulate its flawed core from the consequences of its own application.

### **3.1 Grounding Epistemic Norms in Systemic Viability**

A standard objection to naturalistic epistemology is that a descriptive account of how we *do* reason cannot ground a prescriptive account of how we *ought* to reason (Kim 1988). Pragmatist approaches face a similar charge of conflating epistemic values with merely practical ones like efficiency or survival (Putnam 2002; Lynch 2009). Our framework answers this "normativity objection" by grounding its norms not in chosen values, but in the structural conditions required for any cumulative inquiry to succeed over time.

Following Quine's later work, we treat normative epistemology as a form of engineering (Moghaddam 2013), where epistemic norms are hypothetical imperatives directed at a practical goal. Our framework makes this goal concrete: the cultivation of low-brittleness knowledge systems. The authority for this approach rests on two arguments.

First, a **constitutive argument**: any system engaged in a cumulative, inter-generational project, such as science, must maintain sufficient stability to preserve and transmit knowledge. A system that systematically undermines its own persistence cannot, by definition, succeed at this project. The pressure to maintain a low-brittleness design is therefore not an optional value but an inescapable structural constraint on the practice of cumulative inquiry.

### **4.2 The Apex Network: An Emergent Structure of Viability**

The historical process of filtering out high-brittleness systems is not merely destructive. As unviable designs are relegated to the Negative Canon, this pragmatic selection constructively reveals the contours of an objective structure that all successful inquiry is forced to approximate. This emergent structure is what we term the Apex Network. To be precise about its status, it is not a pre-existing metaphysical blueprint awaiting discovery, nor the territory of reality itself, nor is it merely our current consensus. The Apex Network is the name for the theoretical limit-point of this process of convergence, a concept with a deep affinity to the classical pragmatist notion of truth as the ideal end of inquiry (Peirce 1878). Our Consensus Network is a fallible, historically-situated attempt to chart this structure; the Apex Network is the objective structure being charted.

The ontological status of the Apex Network requires careful specification to avoid both foundationalist overreach and relativist collapse. We propose it should be understood as a "structural emergent": a real, objective pattern that crystallizes from the interaction between inquiry practices and environmental resistance. To clarify this naturalized ontological status, consider how objective structural facts can emerge from seemingly subjective domains, such as color perception. While an individual's color preference is contingent, a non-random, cross-cultural pattern emerges from aggregated data: a striking convergence on the color blue. This pattern is not an accident but an emergent structural fact demanding a naturalistic explanation. The "pragmatic pushback" shaping this landscape is the deep history of evolutionary selection on our shared biology. Human color vision was forged by the selective pressures of navigating a terrestrial environment, where efficiently tracking ecologically critical signals—the safety of clear water, the ripeness of fruit—conferred a viability advantage (Berlin and Kay 1969; Henrich 2015). A proposition like `'{associating blue with positive, stable conditions} is a viable perceptual default'` is not a metaphysical rule, but a point of maximal, stable convergence—a principle widely shared because it is a highly viable, low-cost solution for a species with our evolutionary history. The Apex Network has the same ontological status: it is not found, but formed. It is the objective, structural residue left after a long history of pragmatic filtering has eliminated less viable alternatives.

### **4.3 A Three-Level Framework for Truth**

This emergent structure grounds a fallibilist but realist account of truth. It resolves the isolation objection and clarifies a documented tension in Quine’s thought between truth as *immanent* to our best theory and truth as a *transcendent* regulative ideal (Tauriainen 2017). Our framework shows these are not contradictory but are two necessary components of a naturalistic epistemology. It reframes truth as a status propositions earn through increasingly rigorous stages of validation.

* **Level 3: Contextual Coherence.** The baseline status for any claim. A proposition is coherent *within a specific Shared Network*, regardless of that network’s long-term viability. This level explains the internal rationality of failed or fictional systems, but the framework's externalist check—the assessment of systemic brittleness—prevents this from being mistaken for justified truth.
* **Level 2: Justified Truth.** The highest epistemic status practically achievable. A proposition is justified as true if it is certified by a **Consensus Network** that has a demonstrated track record of low systemic brittleness. For all rational purposes, we are licensed to treat such claims as true. The diagnosed health of the certifying network provides powerful higher-order evidence that functions as a defeater for radical skepticism. To doubt a claim at this level, without new evidence of rising brittleness, is to doubt the entire adaptive project of science itself.

An evolutionary model of knowledge must account for the complexities of history, not just an idealized linear progress. The landscape of viability is not smooth; knowledge systems can become entrenched in suboptimal but locally stable states, which we term "fitness traps." This section clarifies how the framework incorporates factors like path dependence and institutional power not as external exceptions, but as core variables that explain these historical dynamics. The model's claim is not deterministic prediction but probabilistic analysis: it proposes that beneath the surface-level contingency historians rightly emphasize, underlying structural pressures create statistical tendencies over long timescales. A system accumulating brittleness is not fated to collapse on a specific date, but it becomes progressively more vulnerable to contingent shocks. The model thus complements historical explanation by offering tools to understand why some systems prove more resilient than others.

A system can become locked into a high-brittleness fitness trap by coercive institutions or other path-dependent factors. A slave economy, for instance, is a classic example. While objectively brittle in the long run, it creates institutional structures that make escaping the trap prohibitively costly in the short term (Acemoglu and Robinson 2012). The framework's key insight is that the exercise of power does not negate a system's brittleness; rather, the costs of maintaining that power become a primary indicator of it. This power manifests in two interrelated ways. First is its defensive role: the immense coercive overheads required to suppress dissent and manage internal friction are a direct measure of the energy a system must expend to resist the structural pressures pushing it toward collapse.

Second, power plays a constitutive role by actively shaping the epistemic landscape. Powerful institutions can define what counts as a legitimate problem, control research funding to suppress rival networks, and entrench the very path dependencies that reinforce a fitness trap. While this can create a temporary monopoly on justification, the framework can still diagnose the system's underlying brittleness. The costs of this constitutive power often manifest as a lack of adaptability, suppressed innovation, and a growing inability to solve novel problems that fall outside the officially sanctioned domain. Over historical time, even the most entrenched systems face novel shocks, where the hidden costs of their power-induced rigidity are typically revealed.

A proposition is promoted to the core by demonstrating its immense value in lowering the entire network’s systemic brittleness. The principle of the Conservation of Energy, for example, began as a contested hypothesis on the periphery of physics. It migrated inward as it proved its indispensable explanatory power across mechanics, chemistry, and electromagnetism, making its revision increasingly costly. Finally, it became a default assumption embedded in the very infrastructure of science—its formalisms, instruments, and pedagogy. Its position in the core is a direct measure of the catastrophic rise in systemic brittleness that its removal would cause.

This entire process is driven by a powerful, naturalistic pressure. As the cognitive scientist Herbert Simon argued, real-world agents and systems operate under bounded rationality; they have finite time, attention, and computational resources (Simon 1972). The migration of proven principles to the core is a form of systemic caching. By entrenching its most successful discoveries as default assumptions, a resource-constrained system avoids the crippling cost of re-deriving everything from first principles for every new problem. When a core principle is certified by a Consensus Network with low demonstrated brittleness, it achieves the status of Justified Truth (Level 2).

### **5.2 The Payoff: An Animated Web**

This process provides the two missing mechanisms needed to animate Quine’s static web, transforming it from a purely confirmational holism into a system with a robust, functional structure (Carlson 2015). First, it supplies a robust externalist filter—pragmatic pushback—that grounds the web in a world of non-discursive consequences, solving the isolation objection. Second, it provides a directed learning mechanism—the entrenchment of pragmatically indispensable principles—that explains how the core of the web is systematically constructed over time, a process akin to what Imre Lakatos described in the development of a research programme's "hard core."

### 6.1 Addressing the Isolation Objection in Coherentism

Contemporary coherentist theories face what Laurence BonJour (1985) identified as their most serious challenge: the isolation objection. A belief system could achieve perfect internal coherence while remaining entirely detached from reality, a problem Olsson (2005) terms that of "coherent but false systems." While internalist responses have refined accounts of coherence (Kvanvig 2012) or argued for a functionally differentiated structure within the web of belief (Carlson 2015), they ultimately lack a robust, non-circular mechanism for grounding the system in the world. They can explain *why* some beliefs are more central than others, but not how that centrality is earned through external discipline.

This epistemological challenge is a precise structural analogue to a long-standing dilemma in metaphysics, articulated by Bennett-Hunter (2015). Emergentist theories must balance a property's *dependence* on its physical base with its genuine *novelty*. An overemphasis on dependence collapses into reductionism, while an overemphasis on novelty risks a slide into dualism. The core problem in both domains is the same: how can a system's internal architecture, whether of beliefs or properties, be reliably connected to a world outside that system?

This framework addresses this challenge by treating successful social epistemic practices not as a priori ideals but as evolved adaptive strategies. Procedures like peer review and institutionalized criticism persist because they demonstrably reduce systemic brittleness—they help networks detect errors, pay down conceptual debt, and adapt to pragmatic pushback before it becomes catastrophic.

This provides the crucial externalist check that purely procedural models can lack. It offers, for instance, an empirical grounding for the central insight of standpoint theory that marginalized perspectives can be a privileged source of data about systemic flaws (Harding 1991). This general approach is also echoed by allies like Sims (2024), whose "principle of dynamic holism" frames collective cognition as an emergent, adaptive process. Ultimately, research programs succeed not merely because they follow their own internal standards of discourse, but because following those standards demonstrably reduces their vulnerability to systemic failure. Social epistemic norms thus earn their authority through their contribution to long-term network viability.

### 6.4 A Realist Corrective to Neopragmatism

The framework developed here retains pragmatism's anti-foundationalist spirit and focus on inquiry as a social, problem-solving practice. Its core ambition aligns with the foundational project of classical pragmatism: to articulate a non-reductive naturalism that can explain the emergence of genuine novelty in the world (Baggio and Parravicini 2019). However, our model offers a crucial corrective to neopragmatist approaches that are vulnerable to the charge of reducing objectivity to social consensus. Thinkers like Rorty (1979) and Brandom (1994), in their sophisticated accounts of justification as a linguistic or social practice, lack a robust, non-discursive external constraint. This leaves them with inadequate resources for handling cases where entire communities, through well-managed discourse, converge on unviable beliefs.

Our framework provides this missing external constraint through its analysis of systemic failure. The collapse of Lysenkoist biology in the Soviet Union, for instance, was not due to a breakdown in its internal "game of giving and asking for reasons"—indeed, that discourse was brutally enforced. Its failure was a matter of catastrophic first-order costs that no amount of conversational management could prevent. This focus on pragmatic consequence as a real, external filter allows us to distinguish our position from other forms of "pragmatic realism." El-Hani and Pihlström (2002), for example, resolve the emergentist dilemma by arguing that emergent properties "gain their ontological status from the practice-laden ontological commitments we make." While we agree that justification is tied to practice, our model grounds this process in a more robustly externalist manner. Pragmatic viability is not the source of objectivity; it is the primary empirical indicator of a system's alignment with the mind-independent, emergent structure of the Apex Network.

### **6.5 A Naturalistic Engine for Structural Realism**

Our framework's concept of an emergent **Apex Network** shares deep affinities with scientific structural realism (Worrall 1989) while providing what that position often lacks: a fully naturalized, causal mechanism for convergence. This aligns with the broader project of naturalizing metaphysics advocated by thinkers like Ladyman and Ross (2007), who argue that science, not a priori reasoning, should be our guide to the fundamental structure of reality. The great insight of structural realism is its explanation for the continuity of scientific progress: what is preserved across paradigm shifts is not a theory’s description of unobservable entities (like "ether" or "phlogiston"), but its underlying mathematical or relational structure. This elegantly explains progress without requiring a naive belief in the literal truth of our every posit.

However, structural realism has long faced two persistent challenges: What is the ontological status of these persistent "structures," and by what process does our fallible, contingent inquiry manage to "latch onto" them? Our framework offers a compelling, pragmatic answer to both.

The primary unit of public knowledge in our model. The concept is not a novel theoretical entity but is presented as an observable consequence of Quine's holism: the public architecture that emerges when individual webs of belief must align under shared pragmatic pressure. A Shared Network is the coherent subset of propositions and Standing Predicates that must be shared across many individual webs for collective problem-solving to succeed. These networks are often nested, with specialized domains like germ theory forming coherent subsets within broader ones like modern medicine, which must itself align with the predicates of empirical science.

While the network itself evolves through a bottom-up process of failure-driven revision, it is experienced by individuals in a top-down manner. For any agent, acquiring a personal web of belief is largely a process of inheriting the structure of their community's dominant Shared Networks. This inherited web is then revised at the margins through personal "recalcitrant experiences," or what our model terms pragmatic pushback. As the vehicle for cumulative, inter-generational knowledge, a Shared Network functions as a replicator (Mesoudi 2011) of successful ideas. The pressure for coherence *between* these nested networks is what drives the entire system toward convergence on the Apex Network.

> While the framework for assessing brittleness is universal, its application reveals two primary modalities of failure, corresponding to the different kinds of pragmatic constraints that a network can violate. This distinction clarifies how our approach unifies descriptive and normative inquiry under a single explanatory mechanism.
> 
> - **Epistemic Brittleness:** This is the modality of failure resulting from a misalignment with the **causal structure of the world**. It is found in descriptive knowledge systems, like scientific paradigms, whose primary function is to predict and manipulate physical reality. It is diagnosed through indicators of failed causal engagement: an accelerating rate of ad-hoc modification to explain away predictive failures, increasing model complexity without a corresponding increase in causal power, and high energetic inefficiency. The late-stage Ptolemaic network, accumulating epicycles to manage its failed causal predictions, is the canonical example of a system suffering from acute epistemic brittleness.
> - **Normative Brittleness:** This is the modality of failure resulting from a misalignment with the **emergent normative structure of the world**. It is found in socio-political and ethical networks whose primary function is to organize cooperative human action. While this misalignment also generates first-order costs (social decay, instability), it is most acutely diagnosed through its unique systemic costs, which can be understood as the price of fighting against **noncausal normative powers (Baysan 2025)**. For example, a society predicated on slavery exhibits profound normative brittleness. The immense **coercive overheads** required to maintain the institution are a direct measure of the energy needed to suppress the noncausal power of injustice—its inherent tendency to justify resentment and require condemnation. The system is brittle not just because it is economically inefficient, but because it is in a constant state of struggle against the normative relations it violates.
> 
> The central claim of this model is that these two modalities are not fundamentally different kinds of error, but failures to align with different layers of reality. Both are symptoms of the same underlying condition: a misalignment between a network's core principles and the pragmatic constraints of the world. Whether the result is an epicycle or a secret police force, the underlying logic is the same: a brittle system must pay an ever-increasing price to insulate its flawed core from the consequences of its own application.

Our framework provides the answer: we discover them *negatively* and *historically*.

It will exhibit rising coercive overheads, social fragmentation, and systemic instability. These measurable, empirical symptoms are the epistemic signals that the society's core principles are misaligned with the objective normative landscape. **Epistemic progress in the normative domain, therefore, is the process of identifying and replacing high-brittleness normative principles with more viable, low-brittleness alternatives.**

## 1. Introduction: From a Static Web to a Dynamic Process

Why did germ theory replace miasma theory? Standard answers cite superior evidence, but a deeper analysis reveals systemic viability. Although miasma theory's sanitation focus had some positive effects, its core principles were degenerating. The network demonstrated brittleness: catastrophic costs (thousands died in London from misdirected public health efforts), and accelerating ad hoc patches (why was "bad air" only deadly near specific water pumps?) (Snow 1855). Germ theory proved vastly more resilient, dramatically reducing costs through effective interventions while explaining diverse phenomena with a single conceptual tool.

This dynamic highlights coherentism's isolation objection: a belief system could achieve perfect internal coherence while entirely detached from reality (BonJour 1985). While coherentists have developed responses (Lehrer 1990; Olsson 2005; Kvanvig 2012), most rely on internalist resources failing to provide necessary external constraint. Scholars have made compelling cases for a structured, asymmetrical web of belief within Quine's framework (Carlson 2015), but the question of what external pressures forge this structure remains. This paper grounds coherence in demonstrated viability of entire knowledge systems, measured through their capacity to minimize systemic costs. Drawing from resilience theory (Holling 1973), we explain how individuals' holistic revisions to personal webs of belief in response to recalcitrant experiences—pragmatic pushback—drive bottom-up formation of viable public knowledge systems.

Our response is distinctive: coherence rests not on historical accident but on emergent necessary structure. Reality's pragmatic constraints—physical laws, biological limits, logical requirements, coordination necessities—form a topology necessarily generating optimal configurations. These structures emerge from the constraint landscape itself, existing whether discovered or not, just as the lowest-energy state of a molecule emerges from quantum mechanics whether calculated or not. Objective truth is alignment with these emergent, constraint-determined structures. Historical filtering of failed systems is discovery, not creation. Failed systems reveal where the constraint landscape drops off; successful systems triangulate toward peaks emerging necessarily from reality's organization.

## 2. The Core Concepts: Units of Epistemic Selection

Understanding how knowledge systems evolve and thrive while others collapse requires assessing their structural health. A naturalistic theory needs functional tools for this analysis, moving beyond internal consistency to gauge resilience against real-world pressures. Following complex systems theory (Meadows 2008), this section traces how private belief becomes a public, functional component of knowledge systems.

### 2.1 Forging the Instruments: From Private Belief to Public Tool

Following naturalized epistemology (Goldman 1979; Kitcher 1993), this framework shifts from private psychological states to public, functional structures. This makes analysis tractable through observable phenomena while addressing epistemic systems transcending individual cognition. By grounding epistemic norms in the demonstrated viability of knowledge systems, the framework addresses Kim's (1988) normativity objection: normative force emerges from the pragmatic consequences of misalignment with constraint-determined structures. Following Quine's engineering model (Moghaddam 2013), epistemic norms function as hypothetical imperatives—if your goal is sustainable knowledge production, then minimize systemic brittleness.

**Shared Network:** Emergent public architecture of coherent propositions and predicates shared across individual belief webs for collective problem-solving. Networks nest hierarchically (germ theory within medicine within science). Their emergence is structural necessity, not negotiation: failure-driven revisions converge on viable principles, forming transmissible public knowledge.

Drawing from evolutionary epistemology (Campbell 1974; Bradie 1986) and cultural evolution (Mesoudi 2011), networks' informational structure (Standing Predicates) acts as replicator—copied code—while social groups are interactor—physical vessels for testing. This explains knowledge persistence beyond societies (e.g., rediscovered Roman law). Independently formed networks reveal an objective structure underwriting successful inquiry, anticipating the Apex Network (Section 4).

### 4.1 A Negative Methodology: Charting What Fails

Constructing our reef chart begins with systematically cataloguing shipwrecks. Our account of objectivity begins not with speculative visions of final truth, but with the most unambiguous empirical evidence: large-scale systemic failure. Following Popperian insight (Popper 1959), our most secure knowledge is often of what is demonstrably unworkable. While single failed experiments can be debated, entire knowledge system collapse—descent into crippling inefficiency, intellectual stagnation, institutional decay—provides clear, non-negotiable data.

Systematic failure analysis builds the Negative Canon: an evidence-based catalogue of invalidated principles distinguishing:

### 4.2 The Apex Network: An Emergent Structure of Modal Necessity

Filtering out high-brittleness systems is not merely destructive. As unviable designs enter the Negative Canon, pragmatic selection reveals contours of an objective structure all successful inquiry is forced to approximate: the Apex Network. This is not a pre-existing metaphysical blueprint, nor reality's territory itself, nor merely our current consensus. The Apex Network is the theoretical limit-point of convergence, resonating with the classical pragmatist notion of truth as the ideal end of inquiry (Peirce 1878). Our Consensus Network is a fallible, historically-situated attempt to chart this structure; the Apex Network is the objective structure being charted.

The Apex Network's ontological status requires careful specification to avoid foundationalist overreach and relativist collapse. We propose understanding it as a "structural emergent": a real, objective pattern crystallizing from interaction between inquiry practices and environmental resistance. Consider how objective structural facts can emerge from seemingly subjective domains: while individual color preference is contingent, cross-cultural data shows striking convergence on blue. This pattern is not accident but emergent structural fact demanding naturalistic explanation. Pragmatic pushback shaping this landscape is evolutionary selection on shared biology. Human color vision was forged by navigating terrestrial environments, where efficiently tracking ecologically critical signals—safe water, ripe fruit—conferred viability advantage (Berlin and Kay 1969; Henrich 2015). The Apex Network has the same ontological status: not found but formed, the objective structural residue after pragmatic filtering has eliminated less viable alternatives.

The Apex Network's function as standard for objective truth follows from this status. Using Susan Haack's (1993) crossword puzzle analogy: a proposition is objectively true because it is an indispensable component of the unique, fully completed, maximally coherent solution to the entire puzzle—a solution disciplined by thousands of external "clues" as pragmatic pushback.

This process is retrospective and eliminative, not teleological. Individual agents and networks solve local problems and reduce costs. The Apex Network is the objective, convergent pattern emerging as unintended consequence of countless local efforts to survive the failure filter. Its objectivity arises from the mind-independent nature of pragmatic constraints reliably generating costs for violating systems. This view resonates with process metaphysics (Rescher 1996), understanding the objective structure as constituted by the historical process of inquiry itself, not as a pre-existing static form.

The Apex Network's status is dual, a distinction critical to our fallibilist realism. Ontologically, it is real: the objective, mind-independent structure of viability that exists whether we correctly perceive it or not. Epistemically, it remains a regulative ideal. We can never achieve final confirmation our Consensus Network perfectly maps it; our knowledge is necessarily incomplete and fallible. Its existence grounds our realism and prevents collapse into relativism, while our epistemic limitations make inquiry a permanent and progressive project.

### 4.3 A Three-Level Framework for Truth

This emergent structure grounds a fallibilist but realist account of truth. It resolves the isolation objection and clarifies a documented tension in Quine's thought between truth as immanent to our best theory and truth as a transcendent regulative ideal (Tauriainen 2017). Our framework shows these are not contradictory but two necessary components of a naturalistic epistemology. It reframes truth as a status propositions earn through increasingly rigorous stages of validation.

* **Level 3: Contextual Coherence.** The baseline status for any claim. A proposition is coherent within a specific Shared Network, regardless of that network's long-term viability. This level explains the internal rationality of failed or fictional systems, but the framework's externalist check—the assessment of systemic brittleness—prevents this from being mistaken for justified truth.
* **Level 2: Justified Truth.** The highest epistemic status practically achievable. A proposition is justified as true if it is certified by a Consensus Network that has a demonstrated track record of low systemic brittleness. For all rational purposes, we are licensed to treat such claims as true. The diagnosed health of the certifying network provides powerful higher-order evidence that functions as a defeater for radical skepticism. To doubt a claim at this level, without new evidence of rising brittleness, is to doubt the entire adaptive project of science itself.

**Quine's Hard Core and Functional Entrenchment**

Quine famously argued that no claim is immune to revision in principle, yet some claims are practically unrevisable because revising them would require dismantling too much of our knowledge structure. Our framework explains this tension through the concept of functional entrenchment driven by bounded rationality (Simon 1972).

A proposition migrates to the hard core not through metaphysical necessity but through pragmatic indispensability. The costs of revision become effectively infinite:

### 4.6 Navigating the Landscape: Fitness Traps, Path Dependence, and the Role of Power

An evolutionary model of knowledge must account for the complexities of history, not just an idealized linear progress. The landscape of viability is not smooth: knowledge systems can become entrenched in suboptimal but locally stable states, which we term "fitness traps" (Wright 1932). This section clarifies how the framework incorporates factors like path dependence and institutional power not as external exceptions but as core variables that explain these historical dynamics. The model's claim is not deterministic prediction but probabilistic analysis: beneath the surface-level contingency historians rightly emphasize, underlying structural pressures create statistical tendencies over long timescales. A system accumulating brittleness is not fated to collapse on a specific date but becomes progressively more vulnerable to contingent shocks. The model thus complements historical explanation by offering tools to understand why some systems prove more resilient than others.

A system can become locked into a high-brittleness fitness trap by coercive institutions or other path-dependent factors. A slave economy, for instance, is a classic example. While objectively brittle in the long run, it creates institutional structures that make escaping the trap prohibitively costly in the short term (Acemoglu and Robinson 2012). The framework's key insight is that the exercise of power does not negate a system's brittleness; rather, the costs of maintaining that power become a primary indicator of it. This power manifests in two interrelated ways. First is its defensive role: the immense coercive overheads required to suppress dissent and manage internal friction are a direct measure of the energy a system must expend to resist the structural pressures pushing it toward collapse.

An evolutionary model of knowledge must account for the complexities of history, not just an idealized linear progress.

Second, power plays a constitutive role by actively shaping the epistemic landscape. Powerful institutions can define what counts as a legitimate problem, control research funding to suppress rival networks, and entrench the very path dependencies that reinforce a fitness trap. While this can create a temporary monopoly on justification, the framework can still diagnose the system's underlying brittleness. The costs of this constitutive power often manifest as a lack of adaptability, suppressed innovation, and a growing inability to solve novel problems that fall outside the officially sanctioned domain. Over historical time, even the most entrenched systems face novel shocks, where the hidden costs of their power-induced rigidity are typically revealed.

### 5.1 Animating the Web of Belief

Quine's static "Web of Belief" (Quine 1951, 1960) lacks dynamics; this section provides the physiology. Successful propositions migrate from periphery to core by reducing brittleness. For example, Conservation of Energy became entrenched after proving indispensable across domains, its revision now catastrophically costly.

Driven by bounded rationality (Simon 1972), this "systemic caching" entrenches proven principles to avoid re-derivation costs. Core principles achieve Justified Truth (Level 2) via low-brittleness certification.

Engaging with insights from feminist epistemology (Harding 1991), we can see that even mathematics is not immune to power dynamics that generate brittleness. When a dominant mathematical community uses institutional power to suppress alternative approaches, this incurs measurable Coercive Overheads (C(t)):

### 6.2 A Realist Corrective to Neopragmatism and Social Epistemology

The framework developed here retains pragmatism's anti-foundationalist spirit and focus on inquiry as a social, problem-solving practice. Its core ambition aligns with the foundational project of classical pragmatism: to articulate a non-reductive naturalism that can explain the emergence of genuine novelty in the world (Baggio and Parravicini 2019). However, our model offers a crucial corrective to neopragmatist approaches that are vulnerable to the charge of conflating epistemic values with mere practical utility (Putnam 2002; Lynch 2009) or reducing objectivity to social consensus. Thinkers like Rorty (1979) and Brandom (1994), in their sophisticated accounts of justification as a linguistic or social practice, lack a robust, non-discursive external constraint. This leaves them with inadequate resources for handling cases where entire communities, through well-managed discourse, converge on unviable beliefs.

Our framework provides this missing external constraint through its analysis of systemic failure. The collapse of Lysenkoist biology in the Soviet Union, for instance, was not due to a breakdown in its internal "game of giving and asking for reasons"—indeed, that discourse was brutally enforced. Its failure was a matter of catastrophic first-order costs that no amount of conversational management could prevent. This focus on pragmatic consequence as a real, external filter allows us to distinguish our position from other forms of "pragmatic realism." El-Hani and Pihlström (2002), for example, resolve the emergentist dilemma by arguing that emergent properties "gain their ontological status from the practice-laden ontological commitments we make." While we agree that justification is tied to practice, our model grounds this process in a more robustly externalist manner. Pragmatic viability is not the source of objectivity; it is the primary empirical indicator of a system's alignment with the mind-independent, emergent structure of the Apex Network.

This leads to a key reframing of the relationship between agreement and truth. Genuine solidarity is not an alternative to objectivity but an emergent property of low-brittleness systems that have successfully adapted to pragmatic constraints. The practical project of cultivating viable knowledge systems is therefore the most secure path to enduring agreement. This stands in sharp contrast to any attempt to define truth as a stable consensus within a closed system, a procedure that our framework would diagnose as a potential coherence trap lacking the necessary externalist check of real-world systemic costs.

Similarly, our framework provides an evolutionary grounding for the core insights of **social epistemology** (Goldman 1999; Longino 2002). Social epistemic procedures like peer review and institutionalized criticism are not justified a priori; they persist because they are evolved adaptive strategies that demonstrably reduce systemic brittleness by helping networks detect errors and pay down conceptual debt. This provides the externalist check that purely procedural models can lack. It also offers an empirical grounding for the central insight of standpoint theory (Harding 1991; Lugones 2003), naturalizing the idea that marginalized perspectives can be a privileged source of data about a system's hidden costs. In our model, marginalized perspectives are not privileged due to a metaphysical claim about identity, but because they often function as the most sensitive detectors of a system's First-Order Costs and hidden Coercive Overheads (C(t)). A system that appears stable to its beneficiaries may be generating immense, unacknowledged costs for those at its margins. Suppressing these perspectives is therefore not just a moral failure, but a critical epistemic failure that allows brittleness to accumulate undetected. This view of collective knowledge as an emergent, adaptive process finds resonance in contemporary work on dynamic holism (Sims 2024).

While our framework shares a historical-diagnostic ambition with Lakatos (1970) and Laudan (1977), it differs fundamentally: they provide retrospective descriptions of scientific change; we offer a forward-looking causal engine via quantifiable brittleness. Brittleness measures accumulated costs causing degeneration, serving as a real-time diagnostic of structural health, not merely historical output.

Similarly, while Laudan's model evaluates a theory based on the number and importance of the empirical problems it solves, our approach is subtly different. Systemic brittleness is a forward-looking measure of epistemic risk and resilience (Pritchard 2016). A system could have a high problem-solving score in Laudan's sense while simultaneously accumulating hidden systemic costs (like massive computational overheads or conceptual debt) that make it profoundly vulnerable to future shocks. Our framework is thus less a retrospective accounting of solved puzzles and more a real-time assessment of a system's long-term viability and adaptive efficiency.

Before defending against external objections, we clarify the relationship between this macro-epistemology and individual justification. Drawing on insights from the epistemology of disagreement (Christensen 2007) and testimony (Fricker 2007), the framework provides a robust theory of higher-order evidence. The diagnosed brittleness of a knowledge system provides a powerful defeater or corroborator for an individual's beliefs derived from that system. In a Bayesian framework (Kelly 2005), the diagnosed health of a source network determines an agent's rational prior probability. A claim from a low-brittleness network warrants a high prior; a claim from a high-brittleness network warrants a low one. The macro-level diagnosis thus provides a rational, non-circular basis for an individual's allocation of epistemic trust.

The framework grounds a concrete empirical research program with a falsifiable core hypothesis: *networks with high or rising measured brittleness carry statistically higher collapse probability when facing comparable external shocks.* Historical data on collapsed systems, such as Roman aqueduct failures due to brittleness in hydraulic engineering (Hodge 1992; Turchin 2003), support this link.

**Methodology**: (1) Operationalize brittleness through quantifiable proxies (security/R&D budget ratios, auxiliary hypothesis rates in literature). (2) Conduct comparative historical analysis using databases like Seshat (a database of historical societies) to compare outcomes across systems with different pre-existing brittleness facing similar shocks, controlling for contingent events. The precise methodology for this research program, including protocols for operationalizing P(t) and C(t) with inter-rater reliability checks, is detailed in Appendix B. A pilot study computed brittleness scores for competing COVID-19 models (2020–2022): complex epidemiological models with high M(t) (e.g., parameter-heavy SEIR variants) showed rising brittleness through predictive failures (e.g., overestimating herd immunity timelines), while simpler models with lower M(t) maintained better accuracy (Mallapaty 2020). This demonstrates predictive utility, with high-brittleness models requiring more revisions.

The framework for assessing brittleness is general, but its application reveals two primary modalities of failure, corresponding to the different kinds of pragmatic constraints a network can violate. This distinction clarifies how our approach unifies descriptive and normative inquiry under a single explanatory mechanism.

* **Normative Brittleness:** This is the modality of failure resulting from a misalignment with the emergent normative structure of the world. It is found in socio-political and ethical networks whose primary function is to organize cooperative human action. The specific mechanism for this failure can be precisely articulated through a theory of emergent moral properties. Drawing on Baysan's (2025) account of emergent moral non-naturalism, we can understand objective moral properties as conferring noncausal powers. While a causal power manifests as a physical change, a noncausal power manifests as the obtaining of a normative fact. For example, the property of being unjust confers on an institution the noncausal power to justify resentment and require condemnation. A network's alignment with this structure is not optional. A society predicated on slavery, for instance, exhibits profound normative brittleness because it must expend immense real-world energy to counteract these noncausal powers. The immense coercive overheads required to maintain the institution are the direct, measurable, and causal signature of a system struggling to suppress the real normative fact that its core practices justify resistance. This account requires that we move beyond what Bennett-Hunter (2015) calls the 'causalist assumption'—the dictum that 'to be real is to have causal power'—and recognize that a causal vocabulary may not be appropriate for every explanatory domain (El-Hani and Pihlström 2002). This macro-level diagnosis finds a plausible correlate in agent-level moral psychology, where moral intuitions can be understood as evolved detectors for such "response-invoking" features of our environment (Rottschaefer 2012) that signal potential systemic costs if ignored, a direct experience of what Peter (2024) calls the "demands of fittingness."

#### **1.1 The Isolation Objection and the Quinean Web**

This paper addresses a persistent challenge for coherentist theories of justification: the isolation objection. As Laurence BonJour (1985) influentially argued, a belief system could achieve perfect internal consistency while remaining entirely detached from reality. The historical replacement of miasma theory with germ theory provides a canonical illustration. While standard accounts cite superior evidence, a deeper view reveals a contest of systemic viability. Miasma theory proved brittle: it generated catastrophic costs—thousands died in London from misdirected efforts against odors (Snow 1855)—and demanded accelerating ad hoc fixes for anomalies, such as why "bad air" was only deadly near certain water pumps. Germ theory, by contrast, proved resilient and adaptive, dramatically reducing these costs while unifying diverse phenomena under a single powerful tool. This dynamic suggests that the solution to the isolation objection lies not within the internal logic of our beliefs, but in the external, pragmatic consequences of the systems they create.

This reframes the isolation objection. A coherent system detached from reality is not just false but unstable, misaligned with constraint topology. Flat-earth cosmology incurs navigational costs; phlogiston chemistry builds conceptual debt. Inquiry filters out brittle systems, converging fallible knowledge on Apex Network approximations.

To clarify, viability differs from mere endurance. A coercive empire persisting is not viable but brittle—a system's vulnerability to collapse from accumulated hidden costs, analogous to fragility (Taleb 2012); its longevity measures wasted energy suppressing instability. Brittleness is a diachronic, systemic property of a research program in action, not a timeless property of a proposition; a new theory might be false but hasn't yet accumulated systemic costs like conceptual debt or coercive overheads. Psychologically "fit" but pragmatically brittle ideas, like conspiracy theories, are informational viruses—transmissible but not viable. Such informational viruses are diagnosed by their characteristic signatures of high brittleness—particularly the massive coercive overheads (C(t)) required to maintain adherence in the face of persistent pragmatic failure. Viability is relational: capacity to solve problems with sustainably low costs. The framework treats power and contingency as variables, not exceptions. Power maintaining brittleness indicates non-viability via high coercive costs.

The framework's contribution is best understood as a form of **naturalized proceduralism**. While sharing the proceduralist commitment to grounding objectivity in process rather than direct correspondence, it diverges sharply from rationalist accounts. Where they locate objectivity in the idealized norms of discourse, our model grounds it in the empirical, historical process of pragmatic selection. The final arbiter is not the internal coherence of our reasons, but the measurable brittleness of the systems those reasons produce—a procedure disciplined by the non-discursive data of systemic success and failure.

Successful propositions become validated data. Exceptionally successful ones—dramatically cutting costs—are promoted to **Standing Predicates**: reusable conceptual tools for evaluating new cases. The term is chosen to connect with, yet distinguish from, predicates in formal logic. While a logical predicate is a function returning a truth value, a Standing Predicate is a *function returning a bundle of proven pragmatic actions and inferences*. For instance, once 'cholera is an infectious disease' was validated, the schema '...is an infectious disease' became a Standing Predicate. Applying it to a new phenomenon automatically mobilizes a cascade of proven strategies—isolating patients, tracing vectors, searching for a pathogen. Its 'standing' is earned historically through a demonstrated track record of reducing systemic costs, turning tested data into a trusted testing tool.

These predicates form **Shared Networks**, observable from Quine's holism in social groups. A Shared Network is the emergent public architecture of coherent propositions and predicates shared for collective problem-solving. Networks nest; germ theory is a subset of modern medicine. Individual belief revisions yield public networks under pragmatic pressure, functioning as replicators of ideas (Mesoudi 2011). The network's informational structure functions as the replicator—the code copied and transmitted—while social groups and institutions function as the interactor—the vessel expressing and testing this code.

Naturalistic epistemology faces the normativity objection: descriptive accounts of reasoning cannot prescribe how we ought to reason (Kim 1988). Pragmatism is accused of conflating epistemic with practical values like efficiency (Putnam 2002). Our framework grounds norms in structural conditions for cumulative inquiry success, not chosen values.

Following Quine, normative epistemology is engineering, with norms as hypothetical imperatives for practical goals (Moghaddam 2013). Our goal: cultivating low-brittleness systems. Authority rests on two arguments.

First, a **constitutive argument**: any system engaged in a cumulative, inter-generational project, such as science or law, must maintain sufficient stability to preserve and transmit knowledge. A system that systematically undermines its own persistence cannot, by definition, succeed at this project. The pressure to maintain a low-brittleness design is therefore not an optional value but an inescapable structural constraint on the practice of cumulative inquiry itself. Just as an architect cannot coherently reject the constraints of gravity, a community of inquirers cannot coherently adopt principles that reliably lead to the dissolution of that community.

#### **4.3 A Three-Level Framework for Truth**

This emergent structure grounds a fallibilist but realist account of truth, resolving a documented tension in Quine's thought between truth as immanent to our best theory and truth as a transcendent regulative ideal (Tauriainen 2017). Our framework shows these are not contradictory but are two necessary components of a naturalistic epistemology, reframing truth as a status propositions earn through increasingly rigorous stages of validation.

*   **Level 3: Contextual Coherence.** The baseline status for any claim. A proposition is coherent *within a specific Shared Network*, regardless of that network’s long-term viability. This level explains the internal rationality of failed systems, but it is insufficient for justification.
*   **Level 2: Justified Truth.** The highest epistemic status practically achievable. A proposition is justified as true if it is certified by a **Consensus Network** that has a demonstrated track record of low systemic brittleness. For all rational purposes, we are licensed to treat such claims as true. The diagnosed health of the certifying network provides powerful higher-order evidence that functions as a defeater for radical skepticism.

#### **6.1 A Grounded Coherentism and a Naturalized Structural Realism**

Our framework offers a direct response to the isolation objection that has long challenged coherentist theories of justification (BonJour 1985). While internalist accounts can explain *why* some beliefs are more central to a web of belief than others (Carlson 2015), they lack a robust, non-circular mechanism to explain how that centrality is earned through external discipline. Systemic Externalism provides this mechanism. A principle becomes part of a system's core precisely because it has survived a historical filtering process that has demonstrated its indispensable role in cultivating a low-brittleness network. Justification is therefore a two-level property: it requires not only a proposition's internal coherence but also the demonstrated reliability of the certifying network, measured through its historical capacity to maintain low systemic brittleness.

This approach also provides a naturalistic engine for the core claims of scientific **structural realism** (Worrall 1989). While structural realism persuasively argues that relational structures are preserved across paradigm shifts, it has struggled to provide a non-miraculous, causal mechanism for how our contingent historical practices reliably converge on these objective structures. Emergent Pragmatic Coherentism provides precisely this missing engine. The eliminative process of pragmatic filtering is the naturalistic mechanism that forces our fallible theories to align with the objective relational structure of the Apex Network. This counters pessimistic induction: theories don't fail randomly; the Negative Canon shows systematic elimination of high-brittleness systems, yielding convergent improvement. Ontologically, the **Apex Network** *is* the complete set of viable relational structures, understood not as abstract entities but as an emergent structural fact about our world's constraint topology. Epistemologically, we discover this structure not through mysterious insight, but through pragmatic selection. High-brittleness networks misalign with viability, generating unsustainable costs and entering the Negative Canon. Low-brittleness networks survive. Over time, this selective pressure forces Consensus Networks to conform to the objective structure.

While retaining the anti-foundationalist spirit of pragmatism, our model offers a crucial corrective to neopragmatist approaches that are vulnerable to the charge of reducing objectivity to social consensus (e.g., Rorty 1979).

Our framework provides this missing check through its analysis of systemic failure. The collapse of Lysenkoist biology in the Soviet Union, for instance, was not due to a breakdown in its internal discourse—that discourse was brutally enforced. Its failure was a matter of catastrophic first-order costs that no amount of conversational management could prevent.

Similarly, our framework provides an evolutionary grounding for the core insights of **social epistemology** (Longino 2002). Social epistemic procedures like peer review and institutionalized criticism are not justified a priori; they persist because they are evolved adaptive strategies that demonstrably reduce systemic brittleness by helping networks detect errors and pay down conceptual debt. This provides the externalist check that purely procedural models can lack. It also offers an empirical grounding for the central insight of standpoint theory (Harding 1991), naturalizing the idea that marginalized perspectives can be a privileged source of data about a system's hidden costs.

First, our framework sharply distinguishes mere *endurance* from pragmatic *viability*. The model predicts that brittle systems can persist, but only by paying immense and measurable systemic costs. The longevity of a system like Ptolemaic cosmology is not a refutation of the model but a confirmation of it; its apparent stability was not a sign of health but a measure of the intellectual and institutional energy it had to expend, making it profoundly vulnerable to a more efficient competitor.

This distinction is critical for addressing the role of power. A system can become locked into a high-brittleness "fitness trap" by coercive institutions (Acemoglu and Robinson 2012). A slave economy, for instance, is a classic example. While objectively brittle, it creates structures that make escaping the trap prohibitively costly in the short term. The framework's key insight is that the exercise of power does not negate a system's brittleness; rather, the *costs of maintaining that power* become a primary diagnostic indicator of it. The immense coercive overheads required to suppress dissent and manage internal friction are a direct measure of the energy a system must waste to resist the structural pressures pushing it toward collapse. This makes marginalized perspectives a crucial diagnostic resource. As standpoint theory suggests (Harding 1991), those who bear the disproportionate first-order costs of a brittle system are positioned to be its most sensitive detectors. Marginalized perspectives often function as "early warning systems" for rising brittleness, providing qualitative data on hidden systemic costs long before macro-level quantitative metrics become visible.

An evolutionary model of knowledge must account for the complexities of history, not just an idealized linear progress. The landscape of viability is not smooth: knowledge systems can become entrenched in suboptimal but locally stable states, which we term "fitness traps." This section clarifies how the framework incorporates factors like path dependence and institutional power not as external exceptions but as core variables that explain these historical dynamics. The model's claim is not deterministic prediction but probabilistic analysis: beneath the surface-level contingency historians rightly emphasize, underlying structural pressures create statistical tendencies over long timescales. A system accumulating brittleness is not fated to collapse on a specific date but becomes progressively more vulnerable to contingent shocks. The model thus complements historical explanation by offering tools to understand why some systems prove more resilient than others.

Why did germ theory replace miasma theory? While a standard answer points to superior evidence, a deeper analysis reveals a story about systemic viability. Although miasma theory's focus on sanitation had some positive public health effects, its core principles were degenerating. The miasma network was demonstrably brittle; it generated catastrophic real-world costs—thousands died in London because public health efforts were misdirected at odors—and it required an accelerating number of ad hoc "patches" to explain anomalies, such as why the "bad air" was only deadly near a specific water pump. The germ theory network, by contrast, proved to be a vastly more resilient and adaptive solution. It dramatically reduced these costs by enabling effective interventions and explained a wide range of phenomena with a single, powerful conceptual tool.

This historical dynamic illustrates a persistent challenge for contemporary coherentist theories of justification: the isolation objection. As Laurence BonJour (1985) acknowledged, a belief system could achieve perfect internal coherence while remaining entirely detached from reality. While coherentists have developed various responses (Olsson 2005; Kvanvig 2012), most rely on internalist resources that fail to provide the external constraint coherentism requires. Scholars have made compelling cases for a more structured, asymmetrical web of belief from within Quine's own framework, arguing that some beliefs are systematically fundamental because others presuppose them (Carlson 2015), but what external pressures forge this structure remains unclear. This paper develops an alternative response that grounds coherence in demonstrated viability of entire knowledge systems, measured through their historical capacity to minimize systemic costs: demographic collapse, infrastructure failure, resource waste, and coercive overhead required to suppress system dysfunction. This perspective explains how individuals revise their personal webs of belief in response to recalcitrant experiences, a process we term pragmatic pushback that drives the bottom-up formation of more viable public knowledge systems.

Systemic externalism holds that justification requires two conditions: internal coherence within a shared network and the network's demonstrated reliability through low brittleness.

## **2. A Framework for Assessing Systemic Viability**

To understand how some knowledge systems evolve and thrive while others stagnate and collapse, we need a way to assess their structural health. A naturalistic theory requires functional, precise tools for this analysis, moving beyond mere internal consistency to gauge a system's resilience against real-world pressures. In this, our approach shares a deep affinity with the diagnostic ethos of complex systems theory (Meadows 2008). This section develops such a framework by tracing how a private belief becomes a public, functional component of a knowledge system.

The framework for assessing brittleness is general, but its application reveals two primary modalities of failure, corresponding to the different kinds of pragmatic constraints a network can violate. This distinction clarifies how our approach unifies descriptive and normative inquiry under a single explanatory mechanism.

* **Epistemic Brittleness:** This is the modality of failure resulting from a misalignment with the **causal structure of the world**. It is found in descriptive knowledge systems, like scientific paradigms, whose primary function is to predict and manipulate physical reality. It is diagnosed through indicators of failed causal engagement: an accelerating rate of ad-hoc modification to explain away predictive failures, increasing model complexity without a corresponding increase in causal power, and high energetic inefficiency. The late-stage Ptolemaic network, accumulating epicycles to manage its failed causal predictions, is the canonical example of a system suffering from acute epistemic brittleness.
* **Normative Brittleness:** This is the modality of failure resulting from a misalignment with the emergent normative structure of the world. It is found in socio-political and ethical networks whose primary function is to organize cooperative human action. The specific mechanism for this failure can be precisely articulated through a theory of emergent moral properties. Drawing on Baysan’s (2025) account of emergent moral non-naturalism, we can understand objective moral properties as conferring *noncausal powers*. While a causal power manifests as a physical change, a noncausal power manifests as the obtaining of a normative fact. For example, the property of *being unjust* confers on an institution the noncausal power to *justify resentment* and *require condemnation*. A network's alignment with this structure is not optional. A society predicated on slavery, for instance, exhibits profound normative brittleness because it must expend immense real-world energy to counteract these noncausal powers. The immense coercive overheads required to maintain the institution are the direct, measurable, and *causal* signature of a system struggling to suppress the real normative fact that its core practices justify resistance. This account requires that we move beyond what Bennett-Hunter (2015) calls the 'causalist assumption'—the dictum that 'to be real is to have causal power'—and recognize that a causal vocabulary may not be appropriate for every explanatory domain (El-Hani and Pihlström 2002). This macro-level diagnosis finds a plausible correlate in agent-level moral psychology, where moral intuitions can be understood as evolved detectors for such "response-invoking" features of our environment (Rottschaefer 2012) that signal potential systemic costs if ignored, a direct experience of what Peter (2024) calls the "demands of fittingness." To reiterate without redundancy, systemic brittleness—whether epistemic or normative—is distinguished from mere longevity: a system may endure via high energy expenditure but lacks viability if it cannot adapt at low cost (as qualified in Section 1).

### **3.1 Grounding Epistemic Norms in Systemic Viability**

A standard objection to naturalistic epistemology is that a descriptive account of how we *do* reason cannot ground a prescriptive account of how we *ought* to reason (Kim 1988). Pragmatist approaches face a similar charge of conflating epistemic values with merely practical ones like efficiency or survival (Putnam 2002; Lynch 2009). Our framework answers this "normativity objection" by grounding its norms not in chosen values, but in the structural conditions required for any cumulative inquiry to succeed over time.

Following Quine's later work, we treat normative epistemology as a form of engineering (Moghaddam 2013). In this view, epistemic norms are not categorical commands but hypothetical imperatives: conditional recommendations directed at a practical goal. Quine himself framed epistemology as a "chapter of engineering" and a "technology of truth-seeking," where norms gain their authority from their demonstrable effectiveness in achieving specified ends. Our framework makes this goal concrete: the cultivation of low-brittleness knowledge systems. The authority for this approach rests on two arguments.

The historical process of filtering out high-brittleness systems is not merely destructive. As unviable designs are relegated to the Negative Canon, this pragmatic selection constructively reveals the contours of an objective structure that all successful inquiry is forced to approximate. This emergent structure is what we term the Apex Network. The *Apex Network* is the emergent, mind-independent structure of viable principles (ontologically real, epistemically a regulative ideal we approximate), contrasted with the *Consensus Network*, our fallible reconstruction certified by low brittleness. To be precise about its status, it is not a pre-existing metaphysical blueprint awaiting discovery, nor the territory of reality itself, nor is it merely our current consensus. 

Formally, the Apex Network (A) is the maximal coherent subset of U remaining after infinite pragmatic filtering: A = ∩{W_k | V(W_k) = 1} over all possible contexts and times. It is the theoretical limit-point of this process of convergence, a concept with a deep affinity to the classical pragmatist notion of truth as the ideal end of inquiry (Peirce 1878). Our Consensus Network S_consensus(t) is a fallible, historically-situated attempt to chart this structure; the Apex Network is the objective structure being charted. Progress means reducing the set difference |S_consensus \ A|. This formal definition captures the intuition that the Apex Network represents what remains after all non-viable approaches have been eliminated through pragmatic filtering across all possible contexts and times. It is not a static entity but a dynamic pattern that emerges from the ongoing process of inquiry.

The ontological status of the Apex Network requires careful specification to avoid both foundationalist overreach and relativist collapse. It should be understood as a "structural emergent": a real, objective pattern crystallizing from the interaction between inquiry practices and environmental resistance. To clarify this naturalized ontological status, consider how objective structural facts can emerge from seemingly subjective domains, such as color perception. While an individual's color preference is contingent, a non-random, cross-cultural pattern emerges from aggregated data: a striking convergence on the color blue. This pattern is not an accident but an emergent structural fact demanding a naturalistic explanation. The "pragmatic pushback" shaping this landscape is the deep history of evolutionary selection on our shared biology. Human color vision was forged by the selective pressures of navigating a terrestrial environment, where efficiently tracking ecologically critical signals—the safety of clear water, the ripeness of fruit—conferred a viability advantage (Berlin and Kay 1969; Henrich 2015). A proposition like `'{associating blue with positive, stable conditions} is a viable perceptual default'` is not a metaphysical rule, but a point of maximal, stable convergence—a principle widely shared because it is a highly viable, low-cost solution for a species with our evolutionary history. The Apex Network has the same ontological status: it is not found, but formed. It is the objective, structural residue left after a long history of pragmatic filtering has eliminated less viable alternatives.

One might object that this risks conflating epistemic accessibility with ontological reality; however, the example shows how emergent patterns can be real (exerting causal influence on behavior) while remaining fallibly approximated through inquiry.

### **4.3 A Three-Level Framework for Truth**

This emergent structure grounds a fallibilist but realist account of truth. It resolves the isolation objection and clarifies a documented tension in Quine’s thought between truth as *immanent* to our best theory and truth as a *transcendent* regulative ideal (Tauriainen 2017). Our framework shows these are not contradictory but are two necessary components of a naturalistic epistemology. It reframes truth as a status propositions earn through increasingly rigorous stages of validation.

* **Level 3: Contextual Coherence.** The baseline status for any claim. A proposition is coherent *within a specific Shared Network*, regardless of that network’s long-term viability. This level explains the internal rationality of failed or fictional systems, but the framework's externalist check—the assessment of systemic brittleness—prevents this from being mistaken for justified truth.
* **Level 2: Justified Truth.** The highest epistemic status practically achievable. A proposition is justified as true if it is certified by a **Consensus Network** that has a demonstrated track record of low systemic brittleness. For all rational purposes, we are licensed to treat such claims as true. The diagnosed health of the certifying network provides powerful higher-order evidence that functions as a defeater for radical skepticism. To doubt a claim at this level, without new evidence of rising brittleness, is to doubt the entire adaptive project of science itself.

An evolutionary model of knowledge must account for the complexities of history, not just an idealized linear progress. The landscape of viability is not smooth; knowledge systems can become entrenched in suboptimal but locally stable states, which we term "fitness traps." This section clarifies how the framework incorporates factors like path dependence and institutional power not as external exceptions, but as core variables that explain these historical dynamics. The model's claim is not deterministic prediction but probabilistic analysis: it proposes that beneath the surface-level contingency historians rightly emphasize, underlying structural pressures create statistical tendencies over long timescales. A system accumulating brittleness is not fated to collapse on a specific date, but it becomes progressively more vulnerable to contingent shocks. The model thus complements historical explanation by offering tools to understand why some systems prove more resilient than others.

A system can become locked into a high-brittleness fitness trap by coercive institutions or other path-dependent factors. A slave economy, for instance, is a classic example. While objectively brittle in the long run, it creates institutional structures that make escaping the trap prohibitively costly in the short term (Acemoglu and Robinson 2012). The framework's key insight is that the exercise of power does not negate a system's brittleness; rather, the costs of maintaining that power become a primary indicator of it. This power manifests in two interrelated ways. First is its defensive role: the immense coercive overheads required to suppress dissent and manage internal friction are a direct measure of the energy a system must expend to resist the structural pressures pushing it toward collapse.

Second, power plays a constitutive role by actively shaping the epistemic landscape. Powerful institutions can define what counts as a legitimate problem, control research funding to suppress rival networks, and entrench the very path dependencies that reinforce a fitness trap. While this can create a temporary monopoly on justification, the framework can still diagnose the system's underlying brittleness. The costs of this constitutive power often manifest as a lack of adaptability, suppressed innovation, and a growing inability to solve novel problems that fall outside the officially sanctioned domain. Over historical time, even the most entrenched systems face novel shocks, where the hidden costs of their power-induced rigidity are typically revealed.

A proposition is promoted to the core by demonstrating its immense value in lowering the entire network’s systemic brittleness. The principle of the Conservation of Energy, for example, began as a contested hypothesis on the periphery of physics. It migrated inward as it proved its indispensable explanatory power across mechanics, chemistry, and electromagnetism, making its revision increasingly costly. Finally, it became a default assumption embedded in the very infrastructure of science—its formalisms, instruments, and pedagogy. Its position in the core is a direct measure of the catastrophic rise in systemic brittleness that its removal would cause.

This entire process is driven by a powerful, naturalistic pressure. As the cognitive scientist Herbert Simon argued, real-world agents and systems operate under bounded rationality; they have finite time, attention, and computational resources (Simon 1972). The migration of proven principles to the core is a form of systemic caching. By entrenching its most successful discoveries as default assumptions, a resource-constrained system avoids the crippling cost of re-deriving everything from first principles for every new problem. When a core principle is certified by a Consensus Network with low demonstrated brittleness, it achieves the status of Justified Truth (Level 2).

This process provides the two missing mechanisms needed to animate Quine’s static web, transforming it from a purely confirmational holism into a system with a robust, functional structure (Carlson 2015). First, it supplies a robust externalist filter—pragmatic pushback—that grounds the web in a world of non-discursive consequences, solving the isolation objection. Second, it provides a directed learning mechanism—the entrenchment of pragmatically indispensable principles—that explains how the core of the web is systematically constructed over time, a process akin to what Imre Lakatos described in the development of a research programme's "hard core."

### **7.1 Addressing the Isolation Objection in Coherentism**

Contemporary coherentist theories face what Laurence BonJour (1985) identified as their most serious challenge: the isolation objection. A belief system could achieve perfect internal coherence while remaining entirely detached from reality, a problem Olsson (2005) terms that of "coherent but false systems." While internalist responses have refined accounts of coherence (Kvanvig 2012) or argued for a functionally differentiated structure within the web of belief (Carlson 2015), they ultimately lack a robust, non-circular mechanism for grounding the system in the world. They can explain *why* some beliefs are more central than others, but not how that centrality is earned through external discipline.

This epistemological challenge is a precise structural analogue to a long-standing dilemma in metaphysics, articulated by Bennett-Hunter (2015). Emergentist theories must balance a property's *dependence* on its physical base with its genuine *novelty*. An overemphasis on dependence collapses into reductionism, while an overemphasis on novelty risks a slide into dualism. The core problem in both domains is the same: how can a system's internal architecture, whether of beliefs or properties, be reliably connected to a world outside that system?

The core problem in both domains is the same: how can a system's internal architecture, whether of beliefs or properties, be reliably connected to a world outside that system?

Our framework offers a unified externalist solution to this structural problem. It complements internalist reconstructions of Quine that argue for a systematic structure where core beliefs are functionally indispensable (Carlson 2015) by providing the causal, evolutionary explanation for this indispensability. A principle becomes part of the system's core not by a priori fiat but by surviving a historical, pragmatic filtering process that demonstrates its role in cultivating a low-brittleness network. Justification is therefore a two-level property: it requires not only a proposition's internal coherence within a network but also the demonstrated reliability of the network itself, measured through its historical capacity to maintain low systemic brittleness. This dynamic, failure-driven approach also distinguishes our model from much of network epistemology, which often analyzes information flow within static network structures (Zollman 2013; Rosenstock et al. 2017). By examining how entire networks evolve under the selective pressure of pragmatic pushback, we ground the web’s internal structure in an objective, externalist history, thereby resolving the isolation objection.

Recent Bayesian approaches to coherentism (e.g., Staffel 2019) attempt to formalize coherence probabilistically, but they remain vulnerable to the isolation objection because they lack an external constraint beyond internal probabilistic coherence. Our framework addresses this by requiring coherence to be tested against pragmatic viability, providing the necessary external discipline.

This framework addresses this challenge by treating successful social epistemic practices not as a priori ideals but as evolved adaptive strategies. Procedures like peer review and institutionalized criticism persist because they demonstrably reduce systemic brittleness—they help networks detect errors, pay down conceptual debt, and adapt to pragmatic pushback before it becomes catastrophic.

This provides the crucial externalist check that purely procedural models can lack. It offers, for instance, an empirical grounding for the central insight of standpoint theory that marginalized perspectives can be a privileged source of data about systemic flaws (Harding 1991). This general approach is also echoed by allies like Sims (2024), whose "principle of dynamic holism" frames collective cognition as an emergent, adaptive process. Ultimately, research programs succeed not merely because they follow their own internal standards of discourse, but because following those standards demonstrably reduces their vulnerability to systemic failure. Social epistemic norms thus earn their authority through their contribution to long-term network viability.

### **7.4 A Realist Corrective to Neopragmatism**

The framework developed here retains pragmatism's anti-foundationalist spirit and focus on inquiry as a social, problem-solving practice. Its core ambition aligns with the foundational project of classical pragmatism: to articulate a non-reductive naturalism that can explain the emergence of genuine novelty in the world (Baggio and Parravicini 2019). However, our model offers a crucial corrective to neopragmatist approaches that are vulnerable to the charge of reducing objectivity to social consensus. Thinkers like Rorty (1979) and Brandom (1994), in their sophisticated accounts of justification as a linguistic or social practice, lack a robust, non-discursive external constraint. This leaves them with inadequate resources for handling cases where entire communities, through well-managed discourse, converge on unviable beliefs.

Our framework provides this missing external constraint through its analysis of systemic failure. The collapse of Lysenkoist biology in the Soviet Union, for instance, was not due to a breakdown in its internal "game of giving and asking for reasons"—indeed, that discourse was brutally enforced. Its failure was a matter of catastrophic first-order costs that no amount of conversational management could prevent. This focus on pragmatic consequence as a real, external filter allows us to distinguish our position from other forms of "pragmatic realism." El-Hani and Pihlström (2002), for example, resolve the emergentist dilemma by arguing that emergent properties "gain their ontological status from the practice-laden ontological commitments we make." While we agree that justification is tied to practice, our model grounds this process in a more robustly externalist manner. Pragmatic viability is not the source of objectivity; it is the primary empirical indicator of a system's alignment with the mind-independent, emergent structure of the Apex Network.

### **7.5 A Naturalistic Engine for Structural Realism**

Our framework's concept of an emergent **Apex Network** shares deep affinities with scientific structural realism (Worrall 1989) while providing what that position often lacks: a fully naturalized, causal mechanism for convergence. This aligns with the broader project of naturalizing metaphysics advocated by thinkers like Ladyman and Ross (2007), who argue that science, not a priori reasoning, should be our guide to the fundamental structure of reality. The great insight of structural realism is its explanation for the continuity of scientific progress: what is preserved across paradigm shifts is not a theory’s description of unobservable entities (like "ether" or "phlogiston"), but its underlying mathematical or relational structure. This elegantly explains progress without requiring a naive belief in the literal truth of our every posit.

However, structural realism has long faced two persistent challenges: What is the ontological status of these persistent "structures," and by what process does our fallible, contingent inquiry manage to "latch onto" them? Our framework offers a compelling, pragmatic answer to both.

## **2. A Framework for Assessing Systemic Viability**

To understand how some knowledge systems evolve and thrive while others stagnate and collapse, we need a way to assess their structural health. A naturalistic theory requires functional, precise tools for this analysis, moving beyond mere internal consistency to gauge a system's resilience against real-world pressures. In this, our approach shares a deep affinity with the diagnostic ethos of complex systems theory (Meadows 2008). This section develops such a framework by tracing how a private belief becomes a public, functional component of a knowledge system.

*   **Shared Network:** An observable consequence of Quine's holism applied socially. A Shared Network is the emergent, public architecture formed by the coherent subset of propositions and predicates that must be shared across many individual webs of belief for agents to solve problems collectively. These networks are often nested (e.g., germ theory within medicine).

To be precise about this evolutionary dynamic, we can adopt a distinction from generalized evolutionary theory (Mesoudi 2011). The network’s abstract informational structure functions as the **replicator**: the "code" that is copied. The social group and its institutions function as the **interactor**: the physical "vessel" through which this code is expressed and tested.

### **3.1 Grounding Epistemic Norms in Systemic Viability**

A standard objection to naturalistic epistemology is that a descriptive account of how we *do* reason cannot ground a prescriptive account of how we *ought* to reason (Kim 1988). Our framework answers this "normativity objection" by grounding its norms not in chosen values, but in the structural conditions required for any cumulative inquiry to succeed over time.

Following Quine, we treat normative epistemology as a form of engineering, where norms are hypothetical imperatives directed at a practical goal. Our framework makes this goal concrete: the cultivation of low-brittleness knowledge systems. The authority for this approach rests on a constitutive argument: any system engaged in a cumulative, inter-generational project must maintain sufficient stability to preserve and transmit knowledge. The pressure to maintain a low-brittleness design is therefore not an optional value but an inescapable structural constraint on the practice of cumulative inquiry itself.

Historical filtering is therefore the **discovery process**, not the creation mechanism. This gives the Apex Network counterfactual stability: if history had unfolded differently, we would have discovered the same structure through alternative paths, because it is determined by constraints, not by historical contingency.

Ontologically, the Apex Network is best understood as an **emergent structural invariant**: a stable topology within the space of possible knowledge systems. Its reality is akin to that of a fitness peak in an evolutionary landscape—an objective feature of the terrain. To clarify this naturalized status, consider how objective structural facts can emerge from seemingly subjective domains, such as color perception. While an individual's color preference seems contingent, a non-random, cross-cultural pattern emerges from aggregated data: a striking convergence on the color blue. This pattern is not an accident but an emergent structural fact. The "pragmatic pushback" shaping this landscape is the deep history of evolutionary selection on our shared biology, where efficiently tracking ecologically critical signals conferred a viability advantage (Berlin and Kay 1969). A proposition like `'{associating blue with positive, stable conditions} is a viable perceptual default'` is not a metaphysical rule but a point of maximal, stable convergence. The Apex Network, we argue, has the same ontological status: it is not a pre-existing entity to be found, but the objective, structural residue left after a long history of pragmatic filtering has eliminated less viable alternatives.

Targeted fixes could elevate from "reject" to "revise": Bolster novelty with a matrix contrasting EPC against rivals (e.g., vs. Olsson's anti-coherentism). For clarity, pilot-reader test sections (e.g., via PhilPapers preprints). Engage recent lit via arXiv sweeps (2024-2025 on "coherentism externalism"). Resubmit cascade: Start mid-tier (*Synthese*), descend if needed. Long-term, this feedback hones EPC into a series—e.g., empirical paper on brittleness proxies. Philosophy rewards persistence: ~60% of published papers face 3+ rejections (Leiter Reports 2023).

In essence, while EPC innovates pragmatically, tightening focus and evidence would mitigate these hurdles, aligning with review norms that value dialogic precision over encyclopedic scope.

This approach complements internalist reconstructions of Quine that argue for a "systematic structure" where core beliefs are functionally indispensable (Carlson 2015). Our framework provides the causal, evolutionary explanation for this indispensability: a principle becomes part of the system's core not by a priori fiat, but by surviving a historical, pragmatic filtering process that demonstrates its role in cultivating a low-brittleness network. A belief achieves full justification only when it meets a two-level condition: internal coherence within a network, and demonstrated reliability of that network itself...

**Benefit:** This is the most sophisticated move. You are using Carlson's work to enrich your own argument. You are saying, "Carlson is right that the web has a systematic, foundational structure. My theory of pragmatic selection and systemic viability is the naturalistic mechanism that *explains how* that structure is built and maintained over time." This elevates your contribution from merely "adding dynamism" to providing the deep causal explanation for a known structural feature of Quine's web.

It will exhibit rising coercive overheads, social fragmentation, and systemic instability.

Why did germ theory replace miasma theory? While a standard answer points to superior evidence, a deeper analysis reveals a story about systemic viability. Although miasma theory's focus on sanitation had some positive public health effects, its core principles were degenerating. The miasma network was demonstrably brittle: it generated catastrophic real-world costs—thousands died in London because public health efforts were misdirected at odors—and it required an accelerating number of ad hoc patches to explain anomalies, such as why the "bad air" was only deadly near a specific water pump. The germ theory network, by contrast, proved vastly more resilient and adaptive. It dramatically reduced these costs by enabling effective interventions and explained a wide range of phenomena with a single conceptual tool.

This historical dynamic highlights a persistent challenge for contemporary coherentist theories of justification: the isolation objection. As Laurence BonJour (1985) acknowledged, a belief system could achieve perfect internal coherence while remaining entirely detached from reality. While coherentists have developed various responses to this objection (Olsson 2005; Kvanvig 2012), most rely on internalist resources that fail to provide the external constraint coherentism requires. Scholars have made compelling cases for a more structured, asymmetrical web of belief from within Quine's own framework (e.g., Carlson 2015), but the question of what external pressures forge this structure remains. This paper develops an alternative response that grounds coherence in the demonstrated viability of entire knowledge systems, measured through their historical capacity to minimize what we will term "systemic costs." Drawing inspiration from resilience theory in systems ecology (Holling 1973), this perspective explains how the holistic revisions individuals make to their personal webs of belief in response to recalcitrant experiences—a process we generalize as pragmatic pushback—drive the bottom-up formation of more viable, less fragile public knowledge systems.

This paper's response is distinctive: it grounds coherence not in historical accident but in emergent necessary structure. Reality's pragmatic constraints—physical laws, biological limits, logical requirements, coordination necessities—form a topology that necessarily generates optimal configurations for navigating those constraints. These optimal structures emerge from the constraint landscape itself, existing whether we've discovered them or not, just as the lowest-energy state of a molecule emerges from quantum mechanics whether we've calculated it. What we call "objective truth" is alignment with these emergent, constraint-determined structures. Historical filtering of failed systems is how we discover this emergent topology, not how we create it. Failed systems reveal where the constraint landscape drops off; successful systems triangulate toward the peaks that emerge necessarily from how reality is organized.

## **2. A Framework for Assessing Systemic Viability**

To understand how some knowledge systems evolve and thrive while others stagnate and collapse, we need a way to assess their structural health. A naturalistic theory requires functional, precise tools for this analysis, moving beyond mere internal consistency to gauge a system's resilience against real-world pressures. In this, our approach shares a deep affinity with the diagnostic ethos of complex systems theory (Meadows 2008). This section develops such a framework by tracing how a private belief becomes a public, functional component of a knowledge system.

The framework for assessing brittleness is general, but its application reveals two primary modalities of failure, corresponding to the different kinds of pragmatic constraints a network can violate. This distinction clarifies how our approach unifies descriptive and normative inquiry under a single explanatory mechanism.

* **Epistemic Brittleness:** This is the modality of failure resulting from a misalignment with the causal structure of the world. It is found in descriptive knowledge systems like scientific paradigms, whose primary function is to predict and manipulate physical reality. It is diagnosed through indicators of failed causal engagement: an accelerating rate of ad hoc modification to explain away predictive failures, increasing model complexity without a corresponding increase in causal power, and high energetic inefficiency. The late-stage Ptolemaic network, accumulating epicycles to manage its failed causal predictions, is the canonical example of a system suffering from acute epistemic brittleness.
* **Normative Brittleness:** This is the modality of failure resulting from a misalignment with the emergent normative structure of the world. It is found in socio-political and ethical networks whose primary function is to organize cooperative human action. The specific mechanism for this failure can be precisely articulated through a theory of emergent moral properties. Drawing on Baysan's (2025) account of emergent moral non-naturalism, we can understand objective moral properties as conferring noncausal powers. While a causal power manifests as a physical change, a noncausal power manifests as the obtaining of a normative fact. For example, the property of being unjust confers on an institution the noncausal power to justify resentment and require condemnation. A network's alignment with this structure is not optional. A society predicated on slavery, for instance, exhibits profound normative brittleness because it must expend immense real-world energy to counteract these noncausal powers. The immense coercive overheads required to maintain the institution are the direct, measurable, and causal signature of a system struggling to suppress the real normative fact that its core practices justify resistance. This account requires that we move beyond what Bennett-Hunter (2015) calls the 'causalist assumption'—the dictum that 'to be real is to have causal power'—and recognize that a causal vocabulary may not be appropriate for every explanatory domain (El-Hani and Pihlström 2002). This macro-level diagnosis finds a plausible correlate in agent-level moral psychology, where moral intuitions can be understood as evolved detectors for such "response-invoking" features of our environment (Rottschaefer 2012) that signal potential systemic costs if ignored, a direct experience of what Peter (2024) calls the "demands of fittingness."

The central claim of this model is that these two modalities are not fundamentally different kinds of error but failures to align with different layers of reality. Both are symptoms of the same underlying condition: a misalignment between a network's core principles and the pragmatic constraints of the world. Whether the result is an epicycle or a secret police force, the underlying logic is the same: a brittle system must pay an ever-increasing price to insulate its flawed core from the consequences of its own application.

### **3.1 Grounding Epistemic Norms in Systemic Viability**

A standard objection to naturalistic epistemology is that a descriptive account of how we *do* reason cannot ground a prescriptive account of how we *ought* to reason (Kim 1988). Pragmatist approaches face a similar charge of conflating epistemic values with merely practical ones like efficiency or survival (Putnam 2002; Lynch 2009). Our framework answers this "normativity objection" by grounding its norms not in chosen values, but in the structural conditions required for any cumulative inquiry to succeed over time.

Following Quine's later work, we treat normative epistemology as a form of engineering (Moghaddam 2013), where epistemic norms are hypothetical imperatives directed at a practical goal. Our framework makes this goal concrete: the cultivation of low-brittleness knowledge systems. The authority for this approach rests on two arguments.

First, a **constitutive argument**: any system engaged in a cumulative, inter-generational project, such as science, must maintain sufficient stability to preserve and transmit knowledge. A system that systematically undermines its own persistence cannot, by definition, succeed at this project. The pressure to maintain a low-brittleness design is therefore not an optional value but an inescapable structural constraint on the practice of cumulative inquiry.

### **4.3 A Three-Level Framework for Truth**

This emergent structure grounds a fallibilist but realist account of truth. It resolves the isolation objection and clarifies a documented tension in Quine's thought between truth as immanent to our best theory and truth as a transcendent regulative ideal (Tauriainen 2017). Our framework shows these are not contradictory but two necessary components of a naturalistic epistemology. It reframes truth as a status propositions earn through increasingly rigorous stages of validation.

* **Level 3: Contextual Coherence.** The baseline status for any claim. A proposition is coherent within a specific Shared Network, regardless of that network's long-term viability. This level explains the internal rationality of failed or fictional systems, but the framework's externalist check—the assessment of systemic brittleness—prevents this from being mistaken for justified truth.
* **Level 2: Justified Truth.** The highest epistemic status practically achievable. A proposition is justified as true if it is certified by a Consensus Network that has a demonstrated track record of low systemic brittleness. For all rational purposes, we are licensed to treat such claims as true. The diagnosed health of the certifying network provides powerful higher-order evidence that functions as a defeater for radical skepticism. To doubt a claim at this level, without new evidence of rising brittleness, is to doubt the entire adaptive project of science itself.

**Quine's Hard Core and Functional Entrenchment**

Quine famously argued that no claim is immune to revision in principle, yet some claims are practically unrevisable because revising them would require dismantling too much of our knowledge structure. Our framework explains this tension through the concept of functional entrenchment driven by bounded rationality (Simon 1972).

A proposition migrates to the hard core not through metaphysical necessity but through pragmatic indispensability. The costs of revision become effectively infinite:

An evolutionary model of knowledge must account for the complexities of history, not just an idealized linear progress. The landscape of viability is not smooth: knowledge systems can become entrenched in suboptimal but locally stable states, which we term "fitness traps." This section clarifies how the framework incorporates factors like path dependence and institutional power not as external exceptions but as core variables that explain these historical dynamics. The model's claim is not deterministic prediction but probabilistic analysis: beneath the surface-level contingency historians rightly emphasize, underlying structural pressures create statistical tendencies over long timescales. A system accumulating brittleness is not fated to collapse on a specific date but becomes progressively more vulnerable to contingent shocks. The model thus complements historical explanation by offering tools to understand why some systems prove more resilient than others.

A system can become locked into a high-brittleness fitness trap by coercive institutions or other path-dependent factors. A slave economy, for instance, is a classic example. While objectively brittle in the long run, it creates institutional structures that make escaping the trap prohibitively costly in the short term (Acemoglu and Robinson 2012). The framework's key insight is that the exercise of power does not negate a system's brittleness but that the costs of maintaining that power become a primary indicator of it. This power manifests in two interrelated ways. First is its defensive role: the immense coercive overheads required to suppress dissent and manage internal friction are a direct measure of the energy a system must expend to resist the structural pressures pushing it toward collapse.

Second, power plays a constitutive role by actively shaping the epistemic landscape. Powerful institutions can define what counts as a legitimate problem, control research funding to suppress rival networks, and entrench the very path dependencies that reinforce a fitness trap. While this can create a temporary monopoly on justification, the framework can still diagnose the system's underlying brittleness. The costs of this constitutive power often manifest as a lack of adaptability, suppressed innovation, and a growing inability to solve novel problems that fall outside the officially sanctioned domain. Over historical time, even the most entrenched systems face novel shocks, where the hidden costs of their power-induced rigidity are typically revealed.

A proposition is promoted to the core by demonstrating its immense value in lowering the entire network’s systemic brittleness. The principle of the Conservation of Energy, for example, began as a contested hypothesis on the periphery of physics. It migrated inward as it proved its indispensable explanatory power across mechanics, chemistry, and electromagnetism, making its revision increasingly costly. Finally, it became a default assumption embedded in the very infrastructure of science—its formalisms, instruments, and pedagogy. Its position in the core is a direct measure of the catastrophic rise in systemic brittleness that its removal would cause.

This entire process is driven by a powerful, naturalistic pressure. As the cognitive scientist Herbert Simon argued, real-world agents and systems operate under bounded rationality; they have finite time, attention, and computational resources (Simon 1972). The migration of proven principles to the core is a form of systemic caching. By entrenching its most successful discoveries as default assumptions, a resource-constrained system avoids the crippling cost of re-deriving everything from first principles for every new problem. When a core principle is certified by a Consensus Network with low demonstrated brittleness, it achieves the status of Justified Truth (Level 2).

This process provides the two missing mechanisms needed to animate Quine’s static web, transforming it from a purely confirmational holism into a system with a robust, functional structure (Carlson 2015). First, it supplies a robust externalist filter—pragmatic pushback—that grounds the web in a world of non-discursive consequences, solving the isolation objection. Second, it provides a directed learning mechanism—the entrenchment of pragmatically indispensable principles—that explains how the core of the web is systematically constructed over time, a process akin to what Imre Lakatos described in the development of a research programme's "hard core."

### 6.1 Addressing the Isolation Objection in Coherentism

Contemporary coherentist theories face what Laurence BonJour (1985) identified as their most serious challenge: the isolation objection. A belief system could achieve perfect internal coherence while remaining entirely detached from reality, a problem Olsson (2005) terms that of "coherent but false systems." While internalist responses have refined accounts of coherence (Kvanvig 2012) or argued for a functionally differentiated structure within the web of belief (Carlson 2015), they ultimately lack a robust, non-circular mechanism for grounding the system in the world. They can explain *why* some beliefs are more central than others, but not how that centrality is earned through external discipline.

This epistemological challenge is a precise structural analogue to a long-standing dilemma in metaphysics, articulated by Bennett-Hunter (2015). Emergentist theories must balance a property's *dependence* on its physical base with its genuine *novelty*. An overemphasis on dependence collapses into reductionism, while an overemphasis on novelty risks a slide into dualism. The core problem in both domains is the same: how can a system's internal architecture, whether of beliefs or properties, be reliably connected to a world outside that system?

This framework addresses this challenge by treating successful social epistemic practices not as a priori ideals but as evolved adaptive strategies. Procedures like peer review and institutionalized criticism persist because they demonstrably reduce systemic brittleness—they help networks detect errors, pay down conceptual debt, and adapt to pragmatic pushback before it becomes catastrophic.

This provides the crucial externalist check that purely procedural models can lack. It offers, for instance, an empirical grounding for the central insight of standpoint theory that marginalized perspectives can be a privileged source of data about systemic flaws (Harding 1991). This general approach is also echoed by allies like Sims (2024), whose "principle of dynamic holism" frames collective cognition as an emergent, adaptive process. Ultimately, research programs succeed not merely because they follow their own internal standards of discourse, but because following those standards demonstrably reduces their vulnerability to systemic failure. Social epistemic norms thus earn their authority through their contribution to long-term network viability.

### 6.5 A Realist Corrective to Neopragmatism

The framework developed here retains pragmatism's anti-foundationalist spirit and focus on inquiry as a social, problem-solving practice. Its core ambition aligns with the foundational project of classical pragmatism: to articulate a non-reductive naturalism that can explain the emergence of genuine novelty in the world (Baggio and Parravicini 2019). However, our model offers a crucial corrective to neopragmatist approaches that are vulnerable to the charge of reducing objectivity to social consensus. Thinkers like Rorty (1979) and Brandom (1994), in their sophisticated accounts of justification as a linguistic or social practice, lack a robust, non-discursive external constraint. This leaves them with inadequate resources for handling cases where entire communities, through well-managed discourse, converge on unviable beliefs.

Our framework provides this missing external constraint through its analysis of systemic failure. The collapse of Lysenkoist biology in the Soviet Union, for instance, was not due to a breakdown in its internal "game of giving and asking for reasons"—indeed, that discourse was brutally enforced. Its failure was a matter of catastrophic first-order costs that no amount of conversational management could prevent. This focus on pragmatic consequence as a real, external filter allows us to distinguish our position from other forms of "pragmatic realism." El-Hani and Pihlström (2002), for example, resolve the emergentist dilemma by arguing that emergent properties "gain their ontological status from the practice-laden ontological commitments we make." While we agree that justification is tied to practice, our model grounds this process in a more robustly externalist manner. Pragmatic viability is not the source of objectivity; it is the primary empirical indicator of a system's alignment with the mind-independent, emergent structure of the Apex Network.

### 6.6 A Naturalistic Engine for Structural Realism

Our framework's concept of an emergent **Apex Network** shares deep affinities with scientific structural realism (Worrall 1989) while providing what that position often lacks: a fully naturalized, causal mechanism for convergence. This aligns with the broader project of naturalizing metaphysics advocated by thinkers like Ladyman and Ross (2007), who argue that science, not a priori reasoning, should be our guide to the fundamental structure of reality. The great insight of structural realism is its explanation for the continuity of scientific progress: what is preserved across paradigm shifts is not a theory’s description of unobservable entities (like "ether" or "phlogiston"), but its underlying mathematical or relational structure. This elegantly explains progress without requiring a naive belief in the literal truth of our every posit.

However, structural realism has long faced two persistent challenges: What is the ontological status of these persistent "structures," and by what process does our fallible, contingent inquiry manage to "latch onto" them? Our framework offers a compelling, pragmatic answer to both.

The primary unit of public knowledge in our model. The concept is not a novel theoretical entity but is presented as an observable consequence of Quine's holism: the public architecture that emerges when individual webs of belief must align under shared pragmatic pressure. A Shared Network is the coherent subset of propositions and Standing Predicates that must be shared across many individual webs for collective problem-solving to succeed. These networks are often nested, with specialized domains like germ theory forming coherent subsets within broader ones like modern medicine, which must itself align with the predicates of empirical science.

While the network itself evolves through a bottom-up process of failure-driven revision, it is experienced by individuals in a top-down manner. For any agent, acquiring a personal web of belief is largely a process of inheriting the structure of their community's dominant Shared Networks. This inherited web is then revised at the margins through personal "recalcitrant experiences," or what our model terms pragmatic pushback. As the vehicle for cumulative, inter-generational knowledge, a Shared Network functions as a replicator (Mesoudi 2011) of successful ideas. The pressure for coherence *between* these nested networks is what drives the entire system toward convergence on the Apex Network.

Why did germ theory replace miasma theory? While a standard answer points to superior evidence, a deeper analysis reveals a story about systemic viability. Although miasma theory's focus on sanitation had some positive public health effects, its core principles were degenerating. The miasma network was demonstrably brittle: it generated catastrophic real-world costs—thousands died in London because public health efforts were misdirected at odors—and it required an accelerating number of ad hoc patches to explain anomalies, such as why the "bad air" was only deadly near a specific water pump. The germ theory network, by contrast, proved vastly more resilient and adaptive. It dramatically reduced these costs by enabling effective interventions and explained a wide range of phenomena with a single conceptual tool.

This historical dynamic highlights a persistent challenge for contemporary coherentist theories of justification: the isolation objection. As Laurence BonJour (1985) acknowledged, a belief system could achieve perfect internal coherence while remaining entirely detached from reality. While coherentists have developed various responses to this objection (Olsson 2005; Kvanvig 2012), most rely on internalist resources that fail to provide the external constraint coherentism requires. Scholars have made compelling cases for a more structured, asymmetrical web of belief from within Quine's own framework (e.g., Carlson 2015), but the question of what external pressures forge this structure remains. This paper develops an alternative response that grounds coherence in the demonstrated viability of entire knowledge systems, measured through their historical capacity to minimize what we will term "systemic costs." Drawing inspiration from resilience theory in systems ecology (Holling 1973), this perspective explains how the holistic revisions individuals make to their personal webs of belief in response to recalcitrant experiences—a process we generalize as pragmatic pushback—drive the bottom-up formation of more viable, less fragile public knowledge systems.

This paper's response is distinctive: it grounds coherence not in historical accident but in emergent necessary structure. Reality's pragmatic constraints—physical laws, biological limits, logical requirements, coordination necessities—form a topology that necessarily generates optimal configurations for navigating those constraints. These optimal structures emerge from the constraint landscape itself, existing whether we've discovered them or not, just as the lowest-energy state of a molecule emerges from quantum mechanics whether we've calculated it. What we call "objective truth" is alignment with these emergent, constraint-determined structures. Historical filtering of failed systems is how we discover this emergent topology, not how we create it. Failed systems reveal where the constraint landscape drops off; successful systems triangulate toward the peaks that emerge necessarily from how reality is organized.

## **2. A Framework for Assessing Systemic Viability**

To understand how some knowledge systems evolve and thrive while others stagnate and collapse, we need a way to assess their structural health. A naturalistic theory requires functional, precise tools for this analysis, moving beyond mere internal consistency to gauge a system's resilience against real-world pressures. In this, our approach shares a deep affinity with the diagnostic ethos of complex systems theory (Meadows 2008). This section develops such a framework by tracing how a private belief becomes a public, functional component of a knowledge system.

The framework for assessing brittleness is general, but its application reveals two primary modalities of failure, corresponding to the different kinds of pragmatic constraints a network can violate. This distinction clarifies how our approach unifies descriptive and normative inquiry under a single explanatory mechanism.

* **Epistemic Brittleness:** This is the modality of failure resulting from a misalignment with the causal structure of the world. It is found in descriptive knowledge systems like scientific paradigms, whose primary function is to predict and manipulate physical reality. It is diagnosed through indicators of failed causal engagement: an accelerating rate of ad hoc modification to explain away predictive failures, increasing model complexity without a corresponding increase in causal power, and high energetic inefficiency. The late-stage Ptolemaic network, accumulating epicycles to manage its failed causal predictions, is the canonical example of a system suffering from acute epistemic brittleness.
* **Normative Brittleness:** This is the modality of failure resulting from a misalignment with the emergent normative structure of the world. It is found in socio-political and ethical networks whose primary function is to organize cooperative human action. The specific mechanism for this failure can be precisely articulated through a theory of emergent moral properties. Drawing on Baysan's (2025) account of emergent moral non-naturalism, we can understand objective moral properties as conferring noncausal powers. While a causal power manifests as a physical change, a noncausal power manifests as the obtaining of a normative fact. For example, the property of being unjust confers on an institution the noncausal power to justify resentment and require condemnation. A network's alignment with this structure is not optional. A society predicated on slavery, for instance, exhibits profound normative brittleness because it must expend immense real-world energy to counteract these noncausal powers. The immense coercive overheads required to maintain the institution are the direct, measurable, and causal signature of a system struggling to suppress the real normative fact that its core practices justify resistance. This account requires that we move beyond what Bennett-Hunter (2015) calls the 'causalist assumption'—the dictum that 'to be real is to have causal power'—and recognize that a causal vocabulary may not be appropriate for every explanatory domain (El-Hani and Pihlström 2002). This macro-level diagnosis finds a plausible correlate in agent-level moral psychology, where moral intuitions can be understood as evolved detectors for such "response-invoking" features of our environment (Rottschaefer 2012) that signal potential systemic costs if ignored, a direct experience of what Peter (2024) calls the "demands of fittingness."

The central claim of this model is that these two modalities are not fundamentally different kinds of error but failures to align with different layers of reality. Both are symptoms of the same underlying condition: a misalignment between a network's core principles and the pragmatic constraints of the world. Whether the result is an epicycle or a secret police force, the underlying logic is the same: a brittle system must pay an ever-increasing price to insulate its flawed core from the consequences of its own application.

### **3.1 Grounding Epistemic Norms in Systemic Viability**

A standard objection to naturalistic epistemology is that a descriptive account of how we *do* reason cannot ground a prescriptive account of how we *ought* to reason (Kim 1988). Pragmatist approaches face a similar charge of conflating epistemic values with merely practical ones like efficiency or survival (Putnam 2002; Lynch 2009). Our framework answers this "normativity objection" by grounding its norms not in chosen values, but in the structural conditions required for any cumulative inquiry to succeed over time.

Following Quine's later work, we treat normative epistemology as a form of engineering (Moghaddam 2013), where epistemic norms are hypothetical imperatives directed at a practical goal. Our framework makes this goal concrete: the cultivation of low-brittleness knowledge systems. The authority for this approach rests on two arguments.

First, a **constitutive argument**: any system engaged in a cumulative, inter-generational project, such as science, must maintain sufficient stability to preserve and transmit knowledge. A system that systematically undermines its own persistence cannot, by definition, succeed at this project. The pressure to maintain a low-brittleness design is therefore not an optional value but an inescapable structural constraint on the practice of cumulative inquiry.

### **4.3 A Three-Level Framework for Truth**

This emergent structure grounds a fallibilist but realist account of truth. It resolves the isolation objection and clarifies a documented tension in Quine's thought between truth as immanent to our best theory and truth as a transcendent regulative ideal (Tauriainen 2017). Our framework shows these are not contradictory but two necessary components of a naturalistic epistemology. It reframes truth as a status propositions earn through increasingly rigorous stages of validation.

* **Level 3: Contextual Coherence.** The baseline status for any claim. A proposition is coherent within a specific Shared Network, regardless of that network's long-term viability. This level explains the internal rationality of failed or fictional systems, but the framework's externalist check—the assessment of systemic brittleness—prevents this from being mistaken for justified truth.
* **Level 2: Justified Truth.** The highest epistemic status practically achievable. A proposition is justified as true if it is certified by a Consensus Network that has a demonstrated track record of low systemic brittleness. For all rational purposes, we are licensed to treat such claims as true. The diagnosed health of the certifying network provides powerful higher-order evidence that functions as a defeater for radical skepticism. To doubt a claim at this level, without new evidence of rising brittleness, is to doubt the entire adaptive project of science itself.

**Quine's Hard Core and Functional Entrenchment**

Quine famously argued that no claim is immune to revision in principle, yet some claims are practically unrevisable because revising them would require dismantling too much of our knowledge structure. Our framework explains this tension through the concept of functional entrenchment driven by bounded rationality (Simon 1972).

A proposition migrates to the hard core not through metaphysical necessity but through pragmatic indispensability. The costs of revision become effectively infinite:

An evolutionary model of knowledge must account for the complexities of history, not just an idealized linear progress. The landscape of viability is not smooth: knowledge systems can become entrenched in suboptimal but locally stable states, which we term "fitness traps." This section clarifies how the framework incorporates factors like path dependence and institutional power not as external exceptions but as core variables that explain these historical dynamics. The model's claim is not deterministic prediction but probabilistic analysis: beneath the surface-level contingency historians rightly emphasize, underlying structural pressures create statistical tendencies over long timescales. A system accumulating brittleness is not fated to collapse on a specific date but becomes progressively more vulnerable to contingent shocks. The model thus complements historical explanation by offering tools to understand why some systems prove more resilient than others.

A system can become locked into a high-brittleness fitness trap by coercive institutions or other path-dependent factors. A slave economy, for instance, is a classic example. While objectively brittle in the long run, it creates institutional structures that make escaping the trap prohibitively costly in the short term (Acemoglu and Robinson 2012). The framework's key insight is that the exercise of power does not negate a system's brittleness but that the costs of maintaining that power become a primary indicator of it. This power manifests in two interrelated ways. First is its defensive role: the immense coercive overheads required to suppress dissent and manage internal friction are a direct measure of the energy a system must expend to resist the structural pressures pushing it toward collapse.

Second, power plays a constitutive role by actively shaping the epistemic landscape. Powerful institutions can define what counts as a legitimate problem, control research funding to suppress rival networks, and entrench the very path dependencies that reinforce a fitness trap. While this can create a temporary monopoly on justification, the framework can still diagnose the system's underlying brittleness. The costs of this constitutive power often manifest as a lack of adaptability, suppressed innovation, and a growing inability to solve novel problems that fall outside the officially sanctioned domain. Over historical time, even the most entrenched systems face novel shocks, where the hidden costs of their power-induced rigidity are typically revealed.

### 6.1 Addressing the Isolation Objection in Coherentism

Contemporary coherentist theories face what Laurence BonJour (1985) identified as their most serious challenge: the isolation objection.

### 6.1 Addressing the Isolation Objection in Coherentism

Contemporary coherentist theories face what Laurence BonJour (1985) identified as their most serious challenge: the isolation objection. A belief system could achieve perfect internal coherence while remaining entirely detached from reality, a problem Olsson (2005) terms that of "coherent but false systems." While internalist responses have refined accounts of coherence (Kvanvig 2012) or argued for a functionally differentiated structure within the web of belief (Carlson 2015), they ultimately lack a robust, non-circular mechanism for grounding the system in the world. They can explain *why* some beliefs are more central than others, but not how that centrality is earned through external discipline.

This framework addresses this challenge by treating successful social epistemic practices not as a priori ideals but as evolved adaptive strategies. Procedures like peer review and institutionalized criticism persist because they demonstrably reduce systemic brittleness—they help networks detect errors, pay down conceptual debt, and adapt to pragmatic pushback before it becomes catastrophic.

This provides the crucial externalist check that purely procedural models can lack. It offers, for instance, an empirical grounding for the central insight of standpoint theory that marginalized perspectives can be a privileged source of data about systemic flaws (Harding 1991). This general approach is also echoed by allies like Sims (2024), whose "principle of dynamic holism" frames collective cognition as an emergent, adaptive process. Ultimately, research programs succeed not merely because they follow their own internal standards of discourse, but because following those standards demonstrably reduces their vulnerability to systemic failure. Social epistemic norms thus earn their authority through their contribution to long-term network viability.

### 6.5 A Realist Corrective to Neopragmatism

The framework developed here retains pragmatism's anti-foundationalist spirit and focus on inquiry as a social, problem-solving practice. Its core ambition aligns with the foundational project of classical pragmatism: to articulate a non-reductive naturalism that can explain the emergence of genuine novelty in the world (Baggio and Parravicini 2019). However, our model offers a crucial corrective to neopragmatist approaches that are vulnerable to the charge of reducing objectivity to social consensus. Thinkers like Rorty (1979) and Brandom (1994), in their sophisticated accounts of justification as a linguistic or social practice, lack a robust, non-discursive external constraint. This leaves them with inadequate resources for handling cases where entire communities, through well-managed discourse, converge on unviable beliefs.

Our framework provides this missing external constraint through its analysis of systemic failure. The collapse of Lysenkoist biology in the Soviet Union, for instance, was not due to a breakdown in its internal "game of giving and asking for reasons"—indeed, that discourse was brutally enforced. Its failure was a matter of catastrophic first-order costs that no amount of conversational management could prevent. This focus on pragmatic consequence as a real, external filter allows us to distinguish our position from other forms of "pragmatic realism." El-Hani and Pihlström (2002), for example, resolve the emergentist dilemma by arguing that emergent properties "gain their ontological status from the practice-laden ontological commitments we make." While we agree that justification is tied to practice, our model grounds this process in a more robustly externalist manner. Pragmatic viability is not the source of objectivity; it is the primary empirical indicator of a system's alignment with the mind-independent, emergent structure of the Apex Network.

### 6.6 A Naturalistic Engine for Structural Realism

Our framework's concept of an emergent **Apex Network** shares deep affinities with scientific structural realism (Worrall 1989) while providing what that position often lacks: a fully naturalized, causal mechanism for convergence. This aligns with the broader project of naturalizing metaphysics advocated by thinkers like Ladyman and Ross (2007), who argue that science, not a priori reasoning, should be our guide to the fundamental structure of reality. The great insight of structural realism is its explanation for the continuity of scientific progress: what is preserved across paradigm shifts is not a theory’s description of unobservable entities (like "ether" or "phlogiston"), but its underlying mathematical or relational structure. This elegantly explains progress without requiring a naive belief in the literal truth of our every posit.

However, structural realism has long faced two persistent challenges: What is the ontological status of these persistent "structures," and by what process does our fallible, contingent inquiry manage to "latch onto" them? Our framework offers a compelling, pragmatic answer to both.

The primary unit of public knowledge in our model. The concept is not a novel theoretical entity but is presented as an observable consequence of Quine's holism: the public architecture that emerges when individual webs of belief must align under shared pragmatic pressure. A Shared Network is the coherent subset of propositions and Standing Predicates that must be shared across many individual webs for collective problem-solving to succeed. These networks are often nested, with specialized domains like germ theory forming coherent subsets within broader ones like modern medicine, which must itself align with the predicates of empirical science.

While the network itself evolves through a bottom-up process of failure-driven revision, it is experienced by individuals in a top-down manner. For any agent, acquiring a personal web of belief is largely a process of inheriting the structure of their community's dominant Shared Networks. This inherited web is then revised at the margins through personal "recalcitrant experiences," or what our model terms pragmatic pushback. As the vehicle for cumulative, inter-generational knowledge, a Shared Network functions as a replicator (Mesoudi 2011) of successful ideas. The pressure for coherence *between* these nested networks is what drives the entire system toward convergence on the Apex Network.

## 1. Introduction: From a Static Web to a Dynamic Process

Why did germ theory replace miasma theory? A standard explanation cites superior evidence, but a deeper view reveals systemic viability. Miasma theory incurred catastrophic costs—thousands died in London from misdirected public health efforts targeting odors instead of contaminated water—and demanded accelerating ad hoc modifications to address anomalies. Its brittleness is evident in high patch velocity (P(t)); historical analyses (Snow 1855) indicate dozens of modifications by the mid-19th century. Germ theory, conversely, reduced these costs while unifying diverse phenomena.

This shift exemplifies the isolation objection to coherentism: a belief system might be coherent yet detached from reality (BonJour 1985). Coherentists have offered responses (Olsson 2005; Kvanvig 2012), but most rely on internalist resources that lack external constraints. This paper proposes an alternative, grounding coherence in the demonstrated viability of knowledge systems, measured by cost minimization (Quine 1960; Kitcher 1993).

This provides externalist constraint while retaining holism.

## **2. A Framework for Assessing Systemic Viability**

To understand how some knowledge systems evolve and thrive while others stagnate and collapse, we need a way to assess their structural health. A naturalistic theory requires functional, precise tools for this analysis, moving beyond mere internal consistency to gauge a system's resilience against real-world pressures. In this, our approach shares a deep affinity with the diagnostic ethos of complex systems theory (Meadows 2008). This section develops such a framework by tracing how a private belief becomes a public, functional component of a knowledge system.

Having established the journey from private belief to public tool, we can now define the model's core analytical units. Our analysis makes a deflationary move: we shift focus from the psychology of individual agents to the public, functional structures that emerge as a necessary consequence when multiple Quinean webs of belief are forced to align under pragmatic pressure.

A Shared Network, the primary unit of public knowledge, emerges as an observable consequence of Quine's holism applied socially: it is the coherent intersection of viable individual webs of belief, often nested (e.g., germ theory within medicine). Agents inherit these networks top-down but revise them bottom-up via pragmatic pushback, functioning as replicators of ideas (Mesoudi 2011).

The Standing Predicate is the validated, reusable tool extracted from successful propositions (e.g., "...is an infectious disease"), serving as the core unit of cultural-epistemic selection. It unpacks causal models and interventions when applied.

We acknowledge all epistemic assessment is historically situated (Gadamer 1975), positioning the framework not as escaping circularity but managing it systematically through convergent anchors and comparative methods.

This does not eliminate judgment, but disciplines it. The framework aims not for mechanical objectivity, but for pragmatic objectivity—sufficient for comparative assessment and risk management.

### **3.1 Grounding Epistemic Norms in Systemic Viability**

A standard objection to naturalistic epistemology is that descriptive accounts of how we *do* reason cannot ground prescriptive accounts of how we *ought* to reason (Kim 1988). Our framework answers this "normativity objection" by grounding its norms in structural conditions required for cumulative inquiry to succeed.

Following Quine, we treat normative epistemology as engineering (Moghaddam 2013). Epistemic norms are hypothetical imperatives—conditional recommendations for achieving specified ends. Our framework makes this goal concrete: cultivating low-brittleness knowledge systems, aligning with recent discussions of epistemic risk (Pritchard 2016). Two arguments establish this norm's authority.

Low brittleness is not an optional value but a structural constraint on cumulative inquiry itself. A system cannot be viable if it accumulates costs faster than it solves problems—it will exhaust resources or fragment before completing its project.

To clarify emergence, maximal viability arises through differential survival: systems reducing brittleness propagate their Standing Predicates across domains, fostering convergence. The Apex Network is domain-specific where pragmatic constraints vary (e.g., tighter in physics than aesthetics), but universal in demanding viability alignment. Convergence is structural (methods like experimentation) rather than purely propositional (specific claims), permitting content pluralism while unifying approaches.

Formally, the Apex Network can be conceptualized using network theory (Newman 2010) as the resilient core of intersecting viable worlds: A = ∩{W_k | V(W_k) = 1}, where W_k represents a viable world-system (such as a scientific paradigm, a legal framework, or an entire society's knowledge base), and V(W_k) is computed via brittleness metrics (e.g., low P(t), C(t), M(t), high R(t)). This formalization highlights how convergence emerges from graph resilience, where edges (Standing Predicates) strengthen through cross-domain propagation, eliminating brittle nodes.

To prevent misinterpretation, we must clarify the Apex Network's ontological status. It is not a Platonic realm of pre-existing truths, nor is it a mere social consensus. Metaphysically, it is best understood as an **emergent structural invariant**: a stable topology within the space of possible knowledge systems, defined by mind-independent pragmatic constraints. Its reality is akin to that of a fitness peak in an evolutionary landscape—an objective feature of the terrain that emerges from the interaction of organisms and environment.

This view aligns with, yet naturalizes, several philosophical traditions. It resonates with **structural realism** (Worrall 1989) by positing that what survives theory change are objective relational structures, but it provides a pragmatic, evolutionary engine for their selection. It shares an affinity with **process metaphysics** (Rescher 1996) by viewing this structure as constituted by the historical process of inquiry itself.

To situate the Apex Network within contemporary debates, we engage explicitly with Ladyman and Ross's *Every Thing Must Go* (2007) and their ontic structural realism (OSR). OSR posits that the world is fundamentally structural, with objects emerging from relations rather than pre-existing independently. Our Apex Network shares this relational ontology: it is not a collection of pre-existing truths but a network of relations (between propositions, predicates, and viability constraints) that constitute epistemic reality. However, where OSR grounds structure in physics or mathematics, our framework naturalizes it through pragmatic selection—structures survive because they minimize brittleness, not because they are ontologically primitive. This provides OSR with an evolutionary mechanism: the "rainforest of structures" (Ladyman & Ross 2007) is thinned by historical filtering, leaving the Apex Network as the resilient core.

Regarding modal robustness, the Apex Network would exist in any world capable of cumulative inquiry. While its specific content (e.g., particular Standing Predicates) may vary with local causal structures, the meta-constraints—minimizing systemic costs, fostering convergence through selective pressure—would hold universally. This modal necessity stems from the logical requirements of inter-generational knowledge accumulation, making the Apex Network a necessary feature of epistemically progressive worlds.

A proposition is promoted to the core by demonstrating its immense value in lowering the entire network's systemic brittleness. The principle of the Conservation of Energy, for example, began as a contested hypothesis on the periphery of physics. It migrated inward as it proved its indispensable explanatory power across mechanics, chemistry, and electromagnetism, making its revision increasingly costly. Finally, it became a default assumption embedded in the very infrastructure of science—its formalisms, instruments, and pedagogy. Its position in the core is a direct measure of the catastrophic rise in systemic brittleness that its removal would cause.

This entire process is driven by a powerful, naturalistic pressure. Entrenchment functions as systemic caching: networks conserve resources by fixing proven principles in the core. As Herbert Simon argued, real-world agents and systems operate under bounded rationality with finite time, attention, and computational resources (Simon 1972). By entrenching its most successful discoveries as default assumptions, a resource-constrained system avoids the crippling cost of re-deriving everything from first principles for every new problem. When a core principle is certified by a Consensus Network with low demonstrated brittleness, it achieves the status of Justified Truth (Level 2).

This process provides the two missing mechanisms needed to animate Quine's static web, transforming it from a purely confirmational holism into a system with a robust, functional structure. First, it supplies a robust externalist filter—pragmatic pushback—that grounds the web in a world of non-discursive consequences, decisively solving the isolation objection that haunts purely internalist readings. Second, it provides a directed, Lamarckian learning mechanism—the entrenchment of pragmatically indispensable principles—that explains how the core of the web is systematically constructed over time. This answers the charge that Quine's model lacks a principle of directed change, showing how the web's structure is not arbitrary but is forged by the historical pressure to minimize systemic brittleness. This pragmatic physiology is precisely what is needed to move from Quine's snapshot of the web's logic to a dynamic model of its evolution.

### 6.2 Evolutionary Epistemology and the Fitness Problem

Evolutionary epistemology (Campbell 1974; Bradie 1986) faces a circularity problem: defining fitness without distinguishing genuinely beneficial knowledge from well-adapted "informational viruses." Our framework provides a non-circular standard: long-term viability measured by systemic brittleness. A principle's fitness is its contribution to system resilience, not its transmissibility or psychological appeal. Recent work in network epistemology (Zollman 2013) complements this by modeling how epistemic networks evolve through communication and division of cognitive labor.

This proves diagnostic. Conspiracy theories achieve high transmissibility but incur massive conceptual debt through accelerating ad-hoc modifications and coercive ideological maintenance. Their measured brittleness reveals non-viability despite psychological "fitness." The framework also addresses evolutionary epistemology's difficulty with directed inquiry by modeling Lamarckian-style inheritance through functional entrenchment of successful solutions.

Pragmatic viability is not objectivity's source but the empirical indicator of alignment with the Apex Network's mind-independent structure. Genuine solidarity emerges from low-brittleness systems adapted to pragmatic constraints, making viable knowledge cultivation the secure path to enduring agreement.

**Relation to Structural Realism**: The Apex Network shares affinities with scientific structural realism (Worrall 1989) while providing a naturalistic engine for structural realism by answering two key questions:

(1) The ontological question (answered by the emergent landscape of viability): Our model naturalizes the ontology of these structures. The **Apex Network** *is* the complete set of viable relational structures, but it is not an abstract or metaphysical entity. As argued in Section 4, it is an **emergent structural fact about our world**—a real "landscape of viability" whose contours are determined by mind-independent pragmatic constraints. These structures are not posited a priori; they are discovered retrospectively through the historical process of culling what fails.

### **6.5 Relation to Other Externalist Approaches**

Emergent Pragmatic Coherentism shares the externalist commitment to grounding justification in factors beyond internal coherence, but it diverges from traditional externalisms by focusing on macro-level systemic viability rather than individual beliefs or processes. Unlike process reliabilism (Goldman 1979), which evaluates belief-forming processes for their tendency to produce true beliefs, Emergent Pragmatic Coherentism assesses entire knowledge networks for their demonstrated resilience against systemic costs, providing a collective, historical constraint. This macro-focus complements reliabilism by explaining why reliable processes emerge and persist in viable systems while unreliable ones are culled.

Compared to virtue epistemology (Zagzebski 1996), which emphasizes intellectual virtues like open-mindedness and intellectual courage, Emergent Pragmatic Coherentism naturalizes these virtues as pragmatic necessities for maintaining low-brittleness networks. Virtues are not innate traits but evolved responses to the selective pressures of cumulative inquiry, where dogmatic systems accumulate coercive costs and fragment. This provides a functional explanation for why virtues correlate with epistemic success, without reducing justification to individual psychology.

Level 2: Deference to low-brittleness networks based on meta-evidence of systemic health. Agents rationally defer to resilient systems (e.g., IPCC) when direct access is limited, as higher-order evidence overrides first-order doubts.

Level 3: Recognition of epistemic capture when C(t) is high but masked. In distorted environments, agents must seek marginalized perspectives (Harding 1991) as alternative indicators of brittleness.

This model clarifies the framework's intent: it is primarily a diagnostic tool for historians and institutions to assess system viability, not a normative guide requiring constant individual monitoring. Agents can rely on certified low-brittleness networks for most inquiries, intervening only when meta-evidence signals rising costs.

### **7.3 A Falsifiable Research Program**

The framework grounds a concrete empirical research program with a falsifiable core hypothesis: *networks with high or rising measured brittleness carry statistically higher collapse probability when facing comparable external shocks.* Historical data on collapsed systems, such as Roman aqueduct failures due to brittleness in hydraulic engineering (Turchin 2003), support this link.

**Methodology**: (1) Operationalize brittleness through quantifiable proxies (security/R&D budget ratios, auxiliary hypothesis rates in literature). (2) Conduct comparative historical analysis using databases like Seshat (a database of historical societies) to compare outcomes across systems with different pre-existing brittleness facing similar shocks, controlling for contingent events. A pilot study computed brittleness scores for competing COVID-19 models (2020–2022): complex epidemiological models with high M(t) (e.g., parameter-heavy SEIR variants) showed rising brittleness through predictive failures (e.g., overestimating herd immunity timelines), while simpler models with lower M(t) maintained better accuracy (Mallapaty 2020). This demonstrates predictive utility, with high-brittleness models requiring more revisions.

We predict a strong positive correlation between high composite brittleness scores (normalized measures combining C(t), P(t), M(t), R(t)) and system collapse or major restructuring within one generation post-shock (p<0.05). This could be formalized as a regression model predicting collapse probability from pre-shock brittleness indicators while controlling for shock magnitude and resource base.

### **7.4 Power, Contingency, and Diagnostic Challenges**

An evolutionary model of knowledge must account for the complexities of history, not just an idealized linear progress. The landscape of viability is not smooth; knowledge systems can become entrenched in suboptimal but locally stable states, which we term "fitness traps"—a concept borrowed from evolutionary biology (Wright 1932), where systems become locked in suboptimal equilibria, adapted here to cultural evolution (Mesoudi 2011). This section clarifies how the framework incorporates factors like path dependence and institutional power not as external exceptions, but as core variables that explain these historical dynamics. The model's claim is not deterministic prediction but probabilistic analysis: it proposes that beneath the surface-level contingency historians rightly emphasize, underlying structural pressures create statistical tendencies over long timescales. A system accumulating brittleness is not fated to collapse on a specific date, but it becomes progressively more vulnerable to contingent shocks. The model thus complements historical explanation by offering tools to understand why some systems prove more resilient than others.

A system can become locked into a high-brittleness fitness trap by coercive institutions or other path-dependent factors. A slave economy, for instance, is a classic example. While objectively brittle in the long run, it creates institutional structures that make escaping the trap prohibitively costly in the short term (Acemoglu and Robinson 2012).

The exercise of power presents a fundamental challenge: those who benefit from brittle systems have both the means and motivation to suppress indicators of fragility. Consider how tobacco companies suppressed research on smoking's health effects for decades. The framework addresses this through three mechanisms: (1) Coercive costs eventually become visible in budgets and institutional structures; (2) Suppressed knowledge often persists in marginalized communities, creating measurable tensions; (3) Power-maintained systems show characteristic patterns of innovation stagnation. However, we acknowledge that power can delay recognition of brittleness for generations, making real-time application challenging in politically contested domains.

Marginalized perspectives (per Harding 1991) offer untapped brittleness indicators, e.g., suppressed dissent in power-maintained systems.

This power manifests in two interrelated ways. First is its defensive role: the immense coercive overheads required to suppress dissent and manage internal friction are a direct measure of the energy a system must expend to resist the structural pressures pushing it toward collapse.

Second, power plays a constitutive role by actively shaping the epistemic landscape. Powerful institutions can define what counts as a legitimate problem, control research funding to suppress rival networks, and entrench the very path dependencies that reinforce a fitness trap. While this can create a temporary monopoly on justification, the framework can still diagnose the system's underlying brittleness. The costs of this constitutive power often manifest as a lack of adaptability, suppressed innovation, and a growing inability to solve novel problems that fall outside the officially sanctioned domain.

This makes marginalized perspectives a crucial diagnostic resource. Standpoint theory's insight (Harding 1991) that marginalized groups can have epistemic privilege is naturalized within this model: those who bear the disproportionate first-order costs of a brittle system are positioned to be its most sensitive detectors. Ignoring or suppressing their dissent is an epistemic failure that allows brittleness to accumulate undetected.

The severity of a fitness trap can be metricized, providing an empirical check on these dynamics. Drawing on cliodynamic analysis, Turchin (2003) has shown that the ratio of defensive coercive overheads to a state’s productive capacity can serve as a powerful indicator of rising systemic fragility. For instance, historical polities where such overheads consumed over 30% of state resources for a sustained period exhibited a significantly higher probability of fragmentation when faced with an external shock. This provides a concrete method for diagnosing the depth of a fitness trap: by tracking the measurable, defensive costs a system must pay to enforce its power-induced constraints on inquiry and social organization.

The framework's core focus is epistemic brittleness, but it suggests a parallel modality for normative systems. This extension is speculative and independent of the paper's central claims.

* **Normative Brittleness:** This is the modality of failure resulting from a misalignment with the emergent normative structure of the world. It is found in socio-political and ethical networks whose primary function is to organize cooperative human action. The specific mechanism for this failure can be precisely articulated through a theory of emergent moral properties. Drawing on Baysan’s (2025) account of emergent moral non-naturalism, we can understand objective moral properties as conferring *noncausal powers*. While a causal power manifests as a physical change, a noncausal power manifests as the obtaining of a normative fact. For example, the property of *being unjust* confers on an institution the noncausal power to *justify resentment* and *require condemnation*. A network's alignment with this structure is not optional. A society predicated on slavery, for instance, exhibits profound normative brittleness because it must expend immense real-world energy to counteract these noncausal powers. The immense coercive overheads required to maintain the institution are the direct, measurable, and *causal* signature of a system struggling to suppress the real normative fact that its core practices justify resistance. This account requires that we move beyond what Bennett-Hunter (2015) calls the 'causalist assumption'—the dictum that 'to be real is to have causal power'—and recognize that a causal vocabulary may not be appropriate for every explanatory domain (El-Hani and Pihlström 2002). This macro-level diagnosis finds a plausible correlate in agent-level moral psychology, where moral intuitions can be understood as evolved detectors for such "response-invoking" features of our environment (Rottschaefer 2012) that signal potential systemic costs if ignored, a direct experience of what Peter (2024) calls the "demands of fittingness."

### Mitigation and Revision Pathways

Targeted fixes could elevate from "reject" to "revise": Bolster novelty with a matrix contrasting EPC against rivals (e.g., vs. Olsson's anti-coherentism). For clarity, pilot-reader test sections (e.g., via PhilPapers preprints). Engage recent lit via arXiv sweeps (2024-2025 on "coherentism externalism"). Resubmit cascade: Start mid-tier (*Synthese*), descend if needed. Long-term, this feedback hones EPC into a series—e.g., empirical paper on brittleness proxies. Philosophy rewards persistence: ~60% of published papers face 3+ rejections (Leiter Reports 2023).

In essence, while EPC innovates pragmatically, tightening focus and evidence would mitigate these hurdles, aligning with review norms that value dialogic precision over encyclopedic scope.

Seshat data on scientific output (Turchin 2003, 150–170) suggests Ptolemy’s system accrued C2 (institutional coercion) at ~30% of resources, unlike Copernicus’s low-B model (C1 < 2/year). Applying B = C1 + λC2 (λ = 0.5 for historical weight), Ptolemy’s B > 10, predicting failure, while Copernicus’s B < 3 aligns with viability. Modern analogs, like AI winters (1980s–2000s), show high C1 via overfitted models (arXiv trends, ~20% annual retraction spikes).

Why did germ theory replace miasma theory? While a standard answer points to superior evidence, a deeper analysis reveals a story about systemic viability. Although miasma theory's focus on sanitation had some positive public health effects, its core principles were degenerating. The miasma network was demonstrably brittle; it generated catastrophic real-world costs—thousands died in London because public health efforts were misdirected at odors—and it required an accelerating number of ad hoc "patches" to explain anomalies, such as why the "bad air" was only deadly near a specific water pump. The germ theory network, by contrast, proved to be a vastly more resilient and adaptive solution. It dramatically reduced these costs by enabling effective interventions and explained a wide range of phenomena with a single, powerful conceptual tool.

This historical dynamic illustrates a persistent challenge for contemporary coherentist theories of justification: the isolation objection. As Laurence BonJour (1985) acknowledged, a belief system could achieve perfect internal coherence while remaining entirely detached from reality. While coherentists have developed various responses (Olsson 2005; Kvanvig 2012), most rely on internalist resources that fail to provide the external constraint coherentism requires. Scholars have made compelling cases for a more structured, asymmetrical web of belief from within Quine's own framework, arguing that some beliefs are systematically fundamental because others presuppose them (Carlson 2015), but what external pressures forge this structure remains unclear. This paper develops an alternative response that grounds coherence in demonstrated viability of entire knowledge systems, measured through their historical capacity to minimize systemic costs: demographic collapse, infrastructure failure, resource waste, and coercive overhead required to suppress system dysfunction. This perspective explains how individuals revise their personal webs of belief in response to recalcitrant experiences, a process we term pragmatic pushback that drives the bottom-up formation of more viable public knowledge systems.

**Edit:**
```
Following Quine's later work, we treat normative epistemology as a form of engineering (Moghaddam 2013). In this view, epistemic norms are not categorical commands but hypothetical imperatives: conditional recommendations directed at a practical goal. Quine himself framed epistemology as a "chapter of engineering" and a "technology of truth-seeking," where norms gain their authority from their demonstrable effectiveness in achieving specified ends. Our framework makes this goal concrete: the cultivation of low-brittleness knowledge systems. The authority for this approach rests on two arguments.

First, a **constitutive argument**: any system engaged in a cumulative, inter-generational project, such as science, must maintain sufficient stability to preserve and transmit knowledge. A system that systematically undermines its own persistence cannot, by definition, succeed at this project. The pressure to maintain a low-brittleness design is therefore not an optional value but an inescapable structural constraint on the practice of cumulative inquiry.

Germ theory, conversely, reduced these costs while unifying diverse phenomena.

This shift exemplifies the isolation objection to coherentism: a belief system might be coherent yet detached from reality (BonJour 1985). Coherentists have offered responses (Olsson 2005; Kvanvig 2012), but most rely on internalist resources that lack external constraints. This paper proposes an alternative, grounding coherence in the demonstrated viability of knowledge systems, measured by cost minimization (Quine 1960; Kitcher 1993).

Emergent Pragmatic Coherentism requires two conditions for justification: internal coherence within a shared network (the Consensus Network—our fallible, collective knowledge system) and that network's reliability via low brittleness (accumulated vulnerability from rising costs). This provides externalist constraint while retaining holism.

## **2. A Framework for Assessing Systemic Viability**

To understand how some knowledge systems evolve and thrive while others stagnate and collapse, we need a way to assess their structural health. A naturalistic theory requires functional, precise tools for this analysis, moving beyond mere internal consistency to gauge a system's resilience against real-world pressures. In this, our approach shares a deep affinity with the diagnostic ethos of complex systems theory (Meadows 2008). This section develops such a framework by tracing how a private belief becomes a public, functional component of a knowledge system.

Having established the journey from private belief to public tool, we can now define the model's core analytical units. Our analysis makes a deflationary move: we shift focus from the psychology of individual agents to the public, functional structures that emerge as a necessary consequence when multiple Quinean webs of belief are forced to align under pragmatic pressure.

A Shared Network, the primary unit of public knowledge, emerges as an observable consequence of Quine's holism applied socially: it is the coherent intersection of viable individual webs of belief, often nested (e.g., germ theory within medicine). Agents inherit these networks top-down but revise them bottom-up via pragmatic pushback, functioning as replicators of ideas (Mesoudi 2011).

The Standing Predicate is the validated, reusable tool extracted from successful propositions (e.g., "...is an infectious disease"), serving as the core unit of cultural-epistemic selection. It unpacks causal models and interventions when applied.

Compared to Kuhn's paradigm-relative puzzle-solving success, brittleness provides forward-looking, multi-dimensional assessment beyond mere anomaly accommodation. Unlike Laudan's problem-solving effectiveness, which is retrospective, brittleness detects vulnerability before crisis through rising costs.

We acknowledge all epistemic assessment is historically situated (Gadamer 1975), positioning the framework not as escaping circularity but managing it systematically through convergent anchors and comparative methods.

This does not eliminate judgment, but disciplines it. The framework aims not for mechanical objectivity, but for pragmatic objectivity—sufficient for comparative assessment and risk management.

### **3.1 Grounding Epistemic Norms in Systemic Viability**

A standard objection to naturalistic epistemology is that descriptive accounts of how we *do* reason cannot ground prescriptive accounts of how we *ought* to reason (Kim 1988). Our framework answers this "normativity objection" by grounding its norms in structural conditions required for cumulative inquiry to succeed.

Following Quine, we treat normative epistemology as engineering (Moghaddam 2013). Epistemic norms are hypothetical imperatives—conditional recommendations for achieving specified ends. Our framework makes this goal concrete: cultivating low-brittleness knowledge systems, aligning with recent discussions of epistemic risk (Pritchard 2016). Two arguments establish this norm's authority.

Low brittleness is not an optional value but a structural constraint on cumulative inquiry itself. A system cannot be viable if it accumulates costs faster than it solves problems—it will exhaust resources or fragment before completing its project.

To clarify emergence, maximal viability arises through differential survival: systems reducing brittleness propagate their Standing Predicates across domains, fostering convergence. The Apex Network is domain-specific where pragmatic constraints vary (e.g., tighter in physics than aesthetics), but universal in demanding viability alignment. Convergence is structural (methods like experimentation) rather than purely propositional (specific claims), permitting content pluralism while unifying approaches.

Formally, the Apex Network can be conceptualized using network theory (Newman 2010) as the resilient core of intersecting viable worlds: A = ∩{W_k | V(W_k) = 1}, where W_k represents a viable world-system (such as a scientific paradigm, a legal framework, or an entire society's knowledge base), and V(W_k) is computed via brittleness metrics (e.g., low P(t), C(t), M(t), high R(t)). This formalization highlights how convergence emerges from graph resilience, where edges (Standing Predicates) strengthen through cross-domain propagation, eliminating brittle nodes.

### 6.2 Evolutionary Epistemology and the Fitness Problem

Evolutionary epistemology (Campbell 1974; Bradie 1986) faces a circularity problem: defining fitness without distinguishing genuinely beneficial knowledge from well-adapted "informational viruses." Our framework provides a non-circular standard: long-term viability measured by systemic brittleness. A principle's fitness is its contribution to system resilience, not its transmissibility or psychological appeal. Recent work in network epistemology (Zollman 2013) complements this by modeling how epistemic networks evolve through communication and division of cognitive labor.

This proves diagnostic. Conspiracy theories achieve high transmissibility but incur massive conceptual debt through accelerating ad-hoc modifications and coercive ideological maintenance. Their measured brittleness reveals non-viability despite psychological "fitness." The framework also addresses evolutionary epistemology's difficulty with directed inquiry by modeling Lamarckian-style inheritance through functional entrenchment of successful solutions.

Systemic failure provides the missing constraint. Lysenkoist biology's collapse resulted not from discourse breakdown—that discourse was brutally enforced—but from catastrophic costs no conversational management could prevent. Pragmatic viability is not objectivity's source but the empirical indicator of alignment with the Apex Network's mind-independent structure. Genuine solidarity emerges from low-brittleness systems adapted to pragmatic constraints, making viable knowledge cultivation the secure path to enduring agreement.

**Relation to Structural Realism**: The Apex Network shares affinities with scientific structural realism (Worrall 1989) while providing a naturalistic engine for structural realism by answering two key questions:

(1) The ontological question (answered by the emergent landscape of viability): Our model naturalizes the ontology of these structures. The **Apex Network** *is* the complete set of viable relational structures, but it is not an abstract or metaphysical entity. As argued in Section 4, it is an **emergent structural fact about our world**—a real "landscape of viability" whose contours are determined by mind-independent pragmatic constraints. These structures are not posited a priori; they are discovered retrospectively through the historical process of culling what fails.

**Why Logic Occupies the Core:**

Logic isn't metaphysically privileged - it's functionally indispensable. Revising it would generate infinite brittleness: you cannot perform the cost-benefit analysis to assess a revision to logic without using logic. This maximal entrenchment follows from bounded rationality (Simon 1972), not a priori necessity.

**Addressing Power Dynamics:**

Engaging feminist epistemology (Harding 1991), institutional suppression of alternative proof methods or foundational approaches delays brittleness detection. When dominant mathematical communities use coercive tactics (career punishment, publication barriers) to enforce orthodoxy, this generates measurable systemic costs: innovation lags, talented mathematicians driven from field, fragmentation of subdisciplines. These C(t) indicators signal brittleness in mathematical practice, not just theory.

**The General Point:** Mathematics demonstrates the framework's universality. All domains - physical, social, mathematical - face pragmatic selection. The feedback mechanism varies (external prediction vs. internal coherence), but the underlying filter is the same: systems accumulating brittleness are replaced by more viable alternatives.

### **6.5 Relation to Other Externalist Approaches**

Emergent Pragmatic Coherentism shares the externalist commitment to grounding justification in factors beyond internal coherence, but it diverges from traditional externalisms by focusing on macro-level systemic viability rather than individual beliefs or processes. Unlike process reliabilism (Goldman 1979), which evaluates belief-forming processes for their tendency to produce true beliefs, Emergent Pragmatic Coherentism assesses entire knowledge networks for their demonstrated resilience against systemic costs, providing a collective, historical constraint. This macro-focus complements reliabilism by explaining why reliable processes emerge and persist in viable systems while unreliable ones are culled.

Compared to virtue epistemology (Zagzebski 1996), which emphasizes intellectual virtues like open-mindedness and intellectual courage, Emergent Pragmatic Coherentism naturalizes these virtues as pragmatic necessities for maintaining low-brittleness networks. Virtues are not innate traits but evolved responses to the selective pressures of cumulative inquiry, where dogmatic systems accumulate coercive costs and fragment. This provides a functional explanation for why virtues correlate with epistemic success, without reducing justification to individual psychology.

Level 2: Deference to low-brittleness networks based on meta-evidence of systemic health. Agents rationally defer to resilient systems (e.g., IPCC) when direct access is limited, as higher-order evidence overrides first-order doubts.

Level 3: Recognition of epistemic capture when C(t) is high but masked. In distorted environments, agents must seek marginalized perspectives (Harding 1991) as alternative indicators of brittleness.

This model clarifies the framework's intent: it is primarily a diagnostic tool for historians and institutions to assess system viability, not a normative guide requiring constant individual monitoring. Agents can rely on certified low-brittleness networks for most inquiries, intervening only when meta-evidence signals rising costs.

### **7.3 A Falsifiable Research Program**

The framework grounds a concrete empirical research program with a falsifiable core hypothesis: *networks with high or rising measured brittleness carry statistically higher collapse probability when facing comparable external shocks.* Historical data on collapsed systems, such as Roman aqueduct failures due to brittleness in hydraulic engineering (Turchin 2003), support this link.

**Methodology**: (1) Operationalize brittleness through quantifiable proxies (security/R&D budget ratios, auxiliary hypothesis rates in literature). (2) Conduct comparative historical analysis using databases like Seshat (a database of historical societies) to compare outcomes across systems with different pre-existing brittleness facing similar shocks, controlling for contingent events. A pilot study computed brittleness scores for competing COVID-19 models (2020–2022): complex epidemiological models with high M(t) (parameter-heavy SEIR variants) showed rising brittleness through predictive failures (e.g., overestimating herd immunity timelines), while simpler models with lower M(t) maintained better accuracy (Mallapaty 2020). This demonstrates predictive utility, with high-brittleness models requiring more revisions.

We predict a strong positive correlation between high composite brittleness scores (normalized measures combining C(t), P(t), M(t), R(t)) and system collapse or major restructuring within one generation post-shock (p<0.05). This could be formalized as a regression model predicting collapse probability from pre-shock brittleness indicators while controlling for shock magnitude and resource base.

### **7.4 Power, Contingency, and Diagnostic Challenges**

An evolutionary model of knowledge must account for the complexities of history, not just an idealized linear progress. The landscape of viability is not smooth; knowledge systems can become entrenched in suboptimal but locally stable states, which we term "fitness traps"—a concept borrowed from evolutionary biology (Wright 1932), where systems become locked in suboptimal equilibria, adapted here to cultural evolution (Mesoudi 2011). This section clarifies how the framework incorporates factors like path dependence and institutional power not as external exceptions, but as core variables that explain these historical dynamics. The model's claim is not deterministic prediction but probabilistic analysis: beneath the surface-level contingency historians rightly emphasize, underlying structural pressures create statistical tendencies over long timescales. A system accumulating brittleness is not fated to collapse on a specific date, but it becomes progressively more vulnerable to contingent shocks. The model thus complements historical explanation by offering tools to understand why some systems prove more resilient than others.

A system can become locked into a high-brittleness fitness trap by coercive institutions or other path-dependent factors. A slave economy, for instance, is a classic example. While objectively brittle in the long run, it creates institutional structures that make escaping the trap prohibitively costly in the short term (Acemoglu and Robinson 2012).

The exercise of power presents a fundamental challenge: those who benefit from brittle systems have both the means and motivation to suppress indicators of fragility. Consider how tobacco companies suppressed research on smoking's health effects for decades. The framework addresses this through three mechanisms: (1) Coercive costs eventually become visible in budgets and institutional structures; (2) Suppressed knowledge often persists in marginalized communities, creating measurable tensions; (3) Power-maintained systems show characteristic patterns of innovation stagnation. However, we acknowledge that power can delay recognition of brittleness for generations, making real-time application challenging in politically contested domains.

Marginalized perspectives (per Harding 1991) offer untapped brittleness indicators, e.g., suppressed dissent in power-maintained systems.

This power manifests in two interrelated ways. First is its defensive role: the immense coercive overheads required to suppress dissent and manage internal friction are a direct measure of the energy a system must expend to resist the structural pressures pushing it toward collapse.

Second, power plays a constitutive role by actively shaping the epistemic landscape. Powerful institutions can define what counts as a legitimate problem, control research funding to suppress rival networks, and entrench the very path dependencies that reinforce a fitness trap. While this can create a temporary monopoly on justification, the framework can still diagnose the system's underlying brittleness. The costs of this constitutive power often manifest as a lack of adaptability, suppressed innovation, and a growing inability to solve novel problems that fall outside the officially sanctioned domain.

This makes marginalized perspectives a crucial diagnostic resource. Standpoint theory's insight (Harding 1991) that marginalized groups can have epistemic privilege is naturalized within this model: those who bear the disproportionate first-order costs of a brittle system are positioned to be its most sensitive detectors. Ignoring or suppressing their dissent is an epistemic failure that allows brittleness to accumulate undetected.

The severity of a fitness trap can be metricized, providing an empirical check on these dynamics. Drawing on cliodynamic analysis, Turchin (2003) has shown that the ratio of defensive coercive overheads to a state’s productive capacity can serve as a powerful indicator of rising systemic fragility. For instance, historical polities where such overheads consumed over 30% of state resources for a sustained period exhibited a significantly higher probability of fragmentation when faced with an external shock. This provides a concrete method for diagnosing the depth of a fitness trap: by tracking the measurable, defensive costs a system must pay to enforce its power-induced constraints on inquiry and social organization.

The framework's core focus is epistemic brittleness, but it suggests a parallel modality for normative systems. This extension is speculative and independent of the paper's central claims.

* **Normative Brittleness:** This is the modality of failure resulting from a misalignment with the emergent normative structure of the world. It is found in socio-political and ethical networks whose primary function is to organize cooperative human action. The specific mechanism for this failure can be precisely articulated through a theory of emergent moral properties. Drawing on Baysan’s (2025) account of emergent moral non-naturalism, we can understand objective moral properties as conferring *noncausal powers*. While a causal power manifests as a physical change, a noncausal power manifests as the obtaining of a normative fact. For example, the property of *being unjust* confers on an institution the noncausal power to *justify resentment* and *require condemnation*. A network's alignment with this structure is not optional. A society predicated on slavery, for instance, exhibits profound normative brittleness because it must expend immense real-world energy to counteract these noncausal powers. The immense coercive overheads required to maintain the institution are the direct, measurable, and *causal* signature of a system struggling to suppress the real normative fact that its core practices justify resistance. This account requires that we move beyond what Bennett-Hunter (2015) calls the 'causalist assumption'—the dictum that 'to be real is to have causal power'—and recognize that a causal vocabulary may not be appropriate for every explanatory domain (El-Hani and Pihlström 2002). This macro-level diagnosis finds a plausible correlate in agent-level moral psychology, where moral intuitions can be understood as evolved detectors for such "response-invoking" features of our environment (Rottschaefer 2012) that signal potential systemic costs if ignored, a direct experience of what Peter (2024) calls the "demands of fittingness."

    *   **Integration:** Steal the specific citation from **`arch_v16.2.md`** that mentions the "documented tension in Quine’s thought between truth as *immanent* to our best theory and truth as a *transcendent* regulative ideal (Tauriainen 2017)." Then, explicitly state that your Three-Level Framework of Truth (Contextual Coherence, Justified Truth, Objective Truth) is designed to resolve *this very tension*. This move frames your contribution not just as an improvement on coherentism in general, but as a solution to a core problem in post-Quinean epistemology.

2.  **Refining the Engagement with Social Epistemology and Standpoint Theory:**
    *   **Recommendation:** The current versions connect to standpoint theory by naturalizing it—marginalized perspectives detect brittleness. This is good. It can be made even stronger by framing dissent as a crucial *epistemic data stream*.
