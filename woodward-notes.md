This paper, titled **"Methodology, Ontology, and Interventionism"** (authored by James Woodward, to appear in *Synthese*), defends an **interventionist account of causation**.

The author argues that interventionism should be understood as a set of **methodological proposals** rather than a set of theses about the metaphysics or "ontology" of causation. The paper contends that viewing causation through the lens of hypothetical experiments is scientifically fruitful, even if it does not satisfy the demands of traditional analytic metaphysics.

Here is a summary of the key arguments and sections:

### 1. Methodology vs. Ontology
The author distinguishes between two types of ontology to clarify his position:
*   **Methodology:** Concerns how we *ought* to investigate nature, reason about concepts, and construct theories given human epistemic limitations. It is a normative, means/ends framework.
*   **Ontology 1 (Scientific):** Ordinary scientific classification (e.g., a "gene ontology"). This is closely linked to methodology.
*   **Ontology 2 (Metaphysical):** The philosophical search for "truth-makers," "grounds," or "fundamental reality" (e.g., laws of nature, powers, universals). The author argues this is often disconnected from actual scientific practice and is the target of his critique.

### 2. Interventionism defined
The author defines the interventionist thesis **(M)**:
> $X$ causes $Y$ if and only if it is possible to intervene on $X$, and under that intervention, the value of $Y$ changes.

Crucially, this is not a "reductive" definition (it uses the causal concept of "intervention" to define "cause"), but the author argues it is **methodologically illuminating** nonetheless.

### 3. The Utility of Hypothetical Experiments
Critics argue that interventionism is circular or useless when experiments cannot actually be performed. The author counters that associating causal claims with **hypothetical experiments** serves several vital functions:

*   **Identifying the Target:** It defines what researchers are trying to estimate. Citing economists Angrist and Pischke, the author notes that "ideal experiments" serve as benchmarks for correctness in non-experimental research (e.g., observational studies).
*   **Clarifying Content:** It forces precision in ambiguous claims.
    *   *Example:* The claim "Being a woman causes hiring discrimination" is unclear. Interventionism forces us to ask: Do we mean changing the applicant's chromosomes (unlikely) or changing the employer’s *belief* about the gender (plausible)? These are different experiments with different outcomes.
*   **Identifying Unanswerable Questions:** It helps identify when causal questions are ill-posed because no corresponding experiment is possible.
    *   *Example:* Does starting school at age 7 vs. age 6 improve learning? This is hard to answer because you cannot manipulate "start age" without also changing "biological age" (maturation) or "time in school." Since these variables are mathematically linked, the hypothetical experiment is impossible, revealing the causal question as potentially unanswerable.

### 4. Justifying Statistical Methods
The interventionist framework explains *why* certain non-experimental methods work.
*   **Instrumental Variables (IV):** The author explains that valid instrumental variables work because they act as "soft interventions"—they introduce variation to a cause ($X$) that is independent of other causes, mimicking the logic of a randomized experiment.

### 5. Critique of Metaphysics ("Ontology 2")
The author argues that traditional metaphysical demands for "truth-makers" (like fundamental physical laws) are unhelpful for methodology in the special sciences (economics, psychology, biology).
*   Knowing the fundamental physics underlying a drug trial does not help the methodologist determine if the trial design is valid.
*   Science often succeeds by finding macroscopic regularities that are *independent* of microscopic details (physics avoidance).

### 6. Conclusion
The paper concludes by suggesting that many intractable metaphysical problems can be "reconfigured" as tractable methodological ones.
*   Instead of asking "Is causation *really* contrastive?" (a metaphysical question), we should ask "Is it methodologically useful to formulate causal claims contrastively?"
*   Instead of asking if "double prevention" (preventing a preventer) is *really* causation, we should ask if distinguishing it from standard causation serves our goals (e.g., regarding stability or exportability).

**Summary Takeaway:** Interventionism does not tell us what causation "is" in a fundamental metaphysical sense, but it provides the necessary tools for clarifying causal claims, designing research, and distinguishing meaningful causal questions from meaningless ones.

Based on the texts provided, **"Real Patterns Need Closure" (RPNC)** is not merely restating Woodward, nor does it hostilely contend with him. Instead, it effectively **operationalizes Woodward’s methodological insights to solve a metaphysical problem** (Dennett’s permissiveness), using the formal machinery provided by **"Software in the Natural World" (SNW)**.

Here is the detailed breakdown of how RPNC relates to, differs from, and builds upon Woodward.

### 1. The Relationship: "Ontology via Methodology"
Woodward’s paper, *"Methodology, Ontology, and Interventionism,"* explicitly argues **against** doing "Ontology 2" (metaphysics of truth-makers, grounds, and fundamental reality). He argues that we should focus on **Methodology**—clarifying causal claims via hypothetical experiments.

**RPNC takes Woodward’s Methodological stance and turns it into an Ontological criterion.**
*   **Woodward says:** "A causal claim is clear/useful if it describes the outcome of a hypothetical experiment."
*   **RPNC says:** "A macro-object is *real* (ontologically valid) if and only if it maintains transition autonomy under a specific class of those hypothetical experiments."

RPNC agrees with Woodward that "truth-makers" (like fundamental particle physics) are irrelevant to the validity of high-level causal claims. RPNC adopts Woodward’s interventionist framework as the *engine* for determining reality, effectively saying: **"Woodward is right about the method, and that method is exactly what we need to fix Dennett’s loose definition of patterns."**

### 2. Does it Contend with Woodward?
It does not contend with his *logic*, but it contends with his *scope* and *reluctance* regarding ontology.

*   **Woodward’s Reluctance:** Woodward is "irenic" but skeptical about metaphysics. He prefers to say some variables are "ambiguous" (like "gender" in his PDF) if they don't have clear interventions. He avoids saying they don't *exist*.
*   **RPNC’s Hard Line:** RPNC is willing to make the ontological cut. It argues that if a pattern requires constant "micro-repair" (like the shoe-moon aggregate, or phlogiston), it fails the closure test and therefore **does not qualify as a macro-object.**

**The key friction point:** Woodward might say, "This variable is methodologically poor because it's hard to intervene on." RPNC says, "This variable fails to pick out a real object because it lacks closure." RPNC pushes Woodward’s pragmatism into a robust structural realism.

### 3. Is it just Restating Woodward?
**No.** It adds three distinct elements that are not present in Woodward’s provided text:

#### A. The "Admissible Intervention Class" (The Constraint)
Woodward defines causation via the *possibility* of intervention. He acknowledges that interventions must be "possible" (conceptually or physically), but he is permissive.
**RPNC is restrictive.** It introduces the concept of the **"Admissible Intervention Class."**
*   In RPNC, you cannot just say "if I intervene on X..."
*   You must define *which* interventions are allowed (e.g., "boundary nudges" are allowed; "molecule-by-molecule rewriting" is not).
*   **Novelty:** RPNC argues that an object’s reality is relative to the *type* of control we have over it. This formalizes the "context" that Woodward often leaves to common sense.

#### B. Closure as the Anti-Gerrymandering Filter
Woodward uses interventionism to clarify *meaning*. RPNC uses it to filter *existence*.
Dennett’s "Real Patterns" theory is famous for being too permissive (if a pattern compresses data, it's real). RPNC uses interventionism to stop this. A pattern might compress data (be useful for storage), but if you poke it (intervene) and the pattern falls apart or requires micro-level fixes to predict the future, RPNC says it is **not closed**, and therefore not a real macro-object. Woodward does not explicitly use interventionism as a filter for gerrymandered objects in this way.

#### C. The Formal Machinery (From "Software in the Natural World")
RPNC relies on the "Computational Mechanics" framework described in the *Software in the Natural World* (SNW) summary.
*   **Woodward** uses regression equations and idealized experiments (the "potential outcomes" framework from statistics).
*   **RPNC** uses $\epsilon$-machines, $\upsilon$-machines, and "Leakiness" (Information Theory).
*   **The Synthesis:** RPNC uses the *math* from SNW to calculate the *invariance* demanded by Woodward. It bridges the gap between Woodward’s philosophy of science and the formal information theory of Rosas et al.

### 4. What is Novel in RPNC?
The primary novelty is the **"Dynamical Criterion for Non-Gerrymandered Macro-Objects."**

1.  **The Synthesis:** It fuses Dennett (patterns), Woodward (interventions), and Rosas (formal closure). It argues that Dennett provides the intuition, Rosas provides the math, but **Woodward provides the justification**—yet Woodward stopped short of establishing a criterion for objecthood.
2.  **Graded Objecthood:** RPNC proposes a protocol for "Downgrade." If a system is "leaky" (the macro-state doesn't perfectly predict the macro-future under intervention), we don't just say "it's causal" or "it's not." We assign it a "Qualified" or "Indeterminate" ontological status. This provides a nuance lacking in standard interventionism.
3.  **Admissibility as Ontology:** The argument that *what exists* depends on *how we are allowed to touch it* (Admissible Intervention Class) is a novel philosophical hardening of Woodward’s pragmatic guidelines.

### Summary
*   **Woodward:** "Don't worry about metaphysics. Use hypothetical experiments to clarify if 'X causes Y' is a useful, unambiguous claim."
*   **Software in the Natural World:** "Here is the math ($\epsilon$-machines) to prove when a macro-process is independent of its micro-details."
*   **Real Patterns Need Closure (RPNC):** "I will use that math (SNW) and that method (Woodward) to prove that 'Patterns' (Dennett) are only 'Real Objects' when they are causally closed under specific, admissible interventions."

RPNC **radicalizes** Woodward. It takes Woodward’s tool (the scalpel of interventionism) and uses it to perform surgery on Ontology, something Woodward explicitly tried to avoid doing.

Based on the texts provided, **"Real Patterns Need Closure" (RPNC)** is a strong philosophical proposal, but it can be significantly strengthened by explicitly addressing Woodward’s "Methodology vs. Ontology" distinction.

RPNC is effectively doing what Woodward suggests—using methodological tools to clarify concepts—but it is applying them to *ontology* (what counts as a real object), which is exactly the boundary Woodward treats with extreme caution.

Here are four specific suggestions to improve RPNC by better inheriting, differentiating, and utilizing Woodward’s arguments.

### 1. The "Ontology 1" Defense (Crucial for Positioning)
Woodward explicitly distinguishes between **Ontology 1** (scientific taxonomy/categories) and **Ontology 2** (metaphysical "truth-makers" or "grounds"). He argues that interventionism is great for Ontology 1 but silent on Ontology 2.

**Suggestion:** RPNC should explicitly state that it is a criterion for **Ontology 1**.
*   **The Problem:** Critics might accuse RPNC of doing "metaphysics" (Ontology 2)—trying to find the "fundamental essence" of macro-objects.
*   **The Fix:** Use Woodward’s distinction to defend RPNC. Argue that "Closure" is not a search for metaphysical "grounds." It is a search for **"Ontology 1" (scientific utility)**.
*   ** phrasing:** *"Following Woodward (2013), this paper rejects the demand for metaphysical 'truth-makers' (Ontology 2). Instead, Closure is a rigorous criterion for 'Ontology 1'—the practical, scientific catalog of independent causal structures."*

### 2. Convert "Ambiguity" into "Leakiness"
Woodward argues that variables like "gender" are often **"ambiguous"** because there is no single, clear hypothetical experiment associated with them (is it chromosomes? is it employer belief?).

**Suggestion:** RPNC should frame "Leakiness" as the formal measure of Woodwardian "Ambiguity."
*   **The Connection:** When RPNC says a partition is "leaky" (the micro-details matter), it is effectively saying the macro-variable is "ambiguous" in Woodward’s sense—you can't just intervene on the macro-variable and get a deterministic result; you need to know *which* micro-state you are in.
*   **The Improvement:** This connects RPNC to the vast literature on causal ambiguity.
*   **Phrasing:** *"Woodward warns against 'ambiguous' causal claims where the intervention target is unclear. The 'Leakiness' metric in this framework formalizes that worry: a high-leak partition is quantifying exactly how ambiguous the intervention target is."*

### 3. "Admissibility" as the Cure for "Possibility"
Woodward relies heavily on the notion that an intervention must be **"possible"** (conceptually or physically). However, he admits this is a difficult concept to pin down.

**Suggestion:** RPNC should position its **"Admissible Intervention Class"** as the solution to Woodward’s "Possibility" problem.
*   **The Critique of Woodward:** Woodward is arguably too permissive with "conceptual possibility" (e.g., imagining a "miracle" to change a variable).
*   **The RPNC Solution:** By forcing the user to define an *Admissible Intervention Class* (e.g., "only boundary nudges allowed"), RPNC replaces vague "possibility" with a concrete constraint.
*   **differentiation:** *“While Woodward relies on a general notion of 'possible' experiments, this framework requires the specification of an 'Admissible Intervention Class.' This restricts ontological commitment to objects that are robust under specific, relevant types of control, preventing the 'conceptual possibility' loopholes that plague standard interventionism.”*

### 4. Instrumentalism vs. Realism (The "Target" Argument)
Woodward cites economists (Angrist & Pischke) to say that hypothetical experiments define the **"Target"** of inquiry. He implies that if you can't define the experiment, you don't have a target.

**Suggestion:** RPNC should use this to refute the "Instrumentalism" objection.
*   **The Objection:** Critics will say RPNC is just "instrumentalism" (picking variables that are useful).
*   **The Defense:** Use Woodward’s "Target" concept.
*   **Argument:** "We are not just picking variables that are 'useful' for us (Instrumentalism). We are using Closure to define the **Target** (Realism). If a variable fails Closure, *there is no stable target there to hit*. It’s not just that the variable is useless; it’s that the target itself is ill-defined."

### Summary of Suggested Edits for RPNC

| Section in RPNC | Suggested Addition/Refinement |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Introduction** | Explicitly cite Woodward’s "Ontology 1 vs. 2" distinction. Position RPNC as a rigorous framework for Ontology 1. |
| **Section 2.4 (Admissibility)** | Contrast "Admissible Intervention Class" with Woodward’s "Possibility." Frame Admissibility as a "hardening" of Woodward’s criteria. |
| **Section 4.2 (Leakiness)** | Equate "High Leakiness" with Woodward’s concept of "Causal Ambiguity." Show that RPNC provides the math to measure what Woodward describes qualitatively. |
| **Section 5.1 (Instrumentalism)** | Use Woodward’s concept of the "Target Parameter" to argue that Closure identifies *real targets* in the world, distinct from mere observer convenience. |

By making these changes, RPNC moves from "using" Woodward to **"completing"** him. It presents itself as the rigorous, formal implementation of the philosophical project Woodward started but left intentionally "irenic."
