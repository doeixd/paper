## Scope of This Revision

This revision integrates core philosophical moves from `wholes-next.md` into `The Reality of Wholes.md` while preserving the manuscript's existing formal structure, citations, and defensive posture.

## What Was Added

1. **Five-layer clarification in the Introduction**
   - Added an explicit five-layer distinction: reality, patterns, instances, pattern-representations, and instance-representations.
   - Purpose: prevent category collapse that drives recurring objections (for example, conflating model-usefulness with pattern-reality).

2. **Type-level vs token-level closure clarification**
   - Added language in the formal setup of Causal Closure clarifying that closure is assessed at the pattern/regime level before token-level exceptions.
   - Purpose: pre-empt the objection that one anomalous case refutes macro-level reality claims.

3. **Entailed vs stable pattern distinction**
   - Added a distinction between macro-regularities that are entailed by actual microhistory and those that are stable enough for intervention and objecthood.
   - Purpose: tighten the paper's middle ground between eliminativism and loose permissivism.

4. **Snowflake conceptual illustration**
   - Added a concise snowflake illustration to show lawful macro-pattern emergence without token-level exactness.
   - Purpose: make the entailed/stable distinction intuitive without introducing pseudo-quantification.

5. **Logical pluralism clarification in dimensional section**
   - Added a short bridge paragraph explaining that domain-sensitive inferential regimes can vary while remaining constraint-governed.
   - Purpose: block a foreseeable reviewer objection that realism here requires one invariant logic across all domains.

6. **Self-implementing vs implementation-dependent profile distinction**
   - Added a compact classification distinguishing physically self-implementing patterns (storms, crystals) from constraint-defined patterns requiring active enforcement substrates (languages, institutions).
   - Purpose: strengthen social/formal ontology sections without relaxing realism standards.

7. **Structure/implementation/representation triad near formal systems**
   - Added explicit triad language and applied it directly to chess and English.
   - Purpose: unify treatment of mathematical, linguistic, and social patterns under one stable ontological template.

8. **"Invented but not freely" refinement in Platonism section**
   - Added a short clarification that formal systems are invented under intelligibility constraints (identity, compositional inference, coherent consequence).
   - Purpose: preserve anti-Platonist stance while avoiding conventionalist overreach.

9. **Determinism section modal tightening**
   - Revised wording to emphasize actual-history entailment and avoid stronger modal claims than required by the argument.
   - Purpose: reduce vulnerability to modal/metaphysical criticism while keeping the original argumentative trajectory.

## Why These Changes Strengthen the Paper

- They make the core argument more resilient to predictable reviewer attacks about category mistakes, task-relativity, and token-level counterexamples.
- They improve continuity between physical, social, and formal cases by reusing one explicit ontological grammar.
- They preserve the paper's main claim (causal autonomy as the key reality criterion) while reducing avoidable ambiguity.

## Constraints and Style Checks

- Kept examples as conceptual illustrations, not empirical proof points.
- Avoided pseudo-quantification additions.
- Preserved existing citation architecture and did not introduce unverified references.
- Maintained a measured, reviewer-facing academic tone with explicit caveats where needed.
