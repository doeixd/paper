# ITI/CEP Framework Integration

## Summary

Integrated references to Dittrich and Kinne (2024) "The Information-Theoretic Imperative: Compression and the Epistemic Foundations of Intelligence" into the paper at three strategic locations. These additions strengthen the foundational arguments by providing formal mechanistic grounding for the compression-based framework.

## Changes Made

### 1. Section 2.3 - Dispositions as Compression Algorithms (Line 66)

**Purpose:** Establish ITI as the "why" (survival imperative) and CEP as the "how" (efficient compression selects for causal models).

**Content added:** A paragraph explaining that Dittrich and Kinne demonstrate any persisting system must compress information to minimize "epistemic entropy," establishing bounded existence as requiring efficient compression as a constitutive condition. Their Compression Efficiency Principle shows that non-causal compressions "accumulate exceptions" and become unsustainable.

**Rationale:** The paper previously described compression as functionally important but didn't explicitly ground it as a survival necessity. This insertion transforms compression from a useful strategy into a constitutive requirement.

### 2. Section 6.3 - Standing Predicates as Successful Closures (Line 824)

**Purpose:** Connect CEP's "exception accumulation" (micro-level cause) to brittleness metrics (macro-level symptoms).

**Content added:** A paragraph identifying exception accumulation as the characteristic failure mode of non-generative models, and showing how brittleness metrics (P(t), M(t), R(t)) operationalize this at the system level.

**Rationale:** This provides mechanistic grounding for the brittleness framework. The paper now has a principled explanation for why non-causal compressions generate specific failure signatures.

---

### 3. Section 7.1 - The Apex Network (Line 866)

**Purpose:** Link the Apex Network to CEP's account of reality alignment through "reality-filtered data."

**Content added:** A paragraph explaining that surviving agents generate data already embedding causal structure (because only causally accurate compressions enable persistence), and that the Apex Network represents the attractor state where compression efficiency is maximized.

**Rationale:** This explains the convergence mechanism, showing how distributed exploration under survival pressure can approach objective truth without Platonic access.

## Writing Style Compliance

- No em dashes used (replaced with commas, colons, or sentence restructuring)
- Maintained measured academic tone
- Avoided grandiose language
- Used appropriate qualifications while making strong claims
- Preserved philosophical precision
- Integrated smoothly with surrounding text

## Reference Status

The Dittrich and Kinne (2024) reference already exists in `references.md` (line 77). No new reference entry was needed.
