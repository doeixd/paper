# Pre-Submission Review Polish

**Date:** 2026-02-17
**File:** `real-patterns-need-closure-SYNTHESE-sn-submission.tex`

## Summary

Final pre-submission review pass. Fixed three bare inline citations and made four small prose additions that close perception gaps a skeptical reviewer might exploit. No new arguments, no structural changes, no removed content.

## Citation Fixes

Three bare inline citations converted to `\citep{}`:
- `(Dennett, 1991)` → `\citep{dennett1991}` (line ~132)
- `(Woodward, 2015)` → `\citep{woodward2015}` (line ~490)
- `(Hoel et al., 2013)` → `\citep{hoel2013}` (line ~1323)

## Prose Additions

### 1. Admissibility Judgment Acknowledged (§2.4)

Added after the physical-anchoring passage: "The procedure constrains judgment without eliminating it: domain expertise still shapes regime identification and control-channel selection, but that shaping is declared, auditable, and separated from partition scoring."

**Rationale:** The paper already says this in §4.3 ("selection discipline"), but a reviewer reading §2.4 might worry the procedure claims to eliminate all judgment. This sentence heads off that misreading at first contact.

### 2. Type-Token Principle Made Explicit (§4.1)

Added: "Systematic failure, where within-class micro-differences repeatedly matter for macro-transitions across tokens under fixed constraints, is what triggers type-level downgrade rather than token-level exception."

**Rationale:** The paper invokes the type-token distinction in two places (~160 lines apart) without explicitly defining the downgrade trigger. A reviewer might ask "how many anomalous tokens does it take?" This sentence answers: the criterion is whether failure is systematic, not whether it reaches some count.

### 3. Interventional Evidence and Verdict Qualification (§4.9)

Added after the diagnostics agreement passage: "When interventional evidence is sparse or unavailable, the remaining diagnostics can still support qualified status, but robust objecthood requires that the interventional leg not be entirely missing."

**Rationale:** The paper correctly identifies interventional closure as the ontological target (§2.5) and covers sparse intervention access (§4.7), but the triangulation recipe did not explicitly connect missing interventional evidence to verdict qualification. A reviewer could note that §4.9 recommends three checks while §4.7 acknowledges one is often unavailable, without stating the consequence.

### 4. Conservative Objection Reply Sharpened (§5.8)

Added closing sentence: "The criterion is therefore neither eliminativist nor inflationary: it does not deny standing to emerging patterns, but it does not award standing before the dynamical evidence warrants it."

**Rationale:** The reply was correct but ended softly. This punchline positions the framework explicitly between the two failure modes that a Synthese audience will care about.

## What Was Preserved

- All existing citations and qualifications
- All formal machinery (criterion statement, lemma, proof sketch, toy example)
- All objection-reply pairs
- The graded commitment structure (robust/qualified/indeterminate)

## Net Effect

- 3 bare citations fixed
- ~8 lines of prose added across 4 locations
- No content removed
- PDF compiles cleanly, 27 pages
