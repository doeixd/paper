## Scope

Implemented the requested next-step pass on `real-patterns-need-closure-SYNTHESE.md` by deepening core argument sections, consolidating objections, and tightening in-body literature dialogue.

## Main Revisions

1. Deepened criterion-level ontology argumentation in Section 2.
   - Added explicit contrast paragraph in 2.3 linking closure move to Dennett and Ladyman-Ross commitments.
   - Added new 2.10 (`Why Closure Carries Ontological Weight`) to explain why closure is not merely a modeling heuristic under stated commitments.

2. Expanded approximate-closure evidential logic in Section 4.
   - Added explicit L&R projectibility tie in 4.4.
   - Added new 4.12 (`From Diagnostics to Warranted Commitment`) to clarify proxy evidence, convergence logic, and graded verdict rationale.

3. Consolidated objection architecture in Section 5.
   - Added opening progression map for objections.
   - Merged predictive-success, methods-note, and failure-condition concerns into a single stronger cluster section (5.8).
   - Renumbered later objections for cleaner flow.

4. Strengthened literature contrasts in body sections.
   - Added explicit in-body dialogue with Dennett, Ladyman & Ross, Rosas, and Kim.
   - Added Kim-targeted clarification in causal-exclusion reply for stronger referee-facing precision.

## Outcome

The manuscript now has stronger criterion-to-evidence continuity and a more coherent objection progression while maintaining scope discipline. Word count is now approximately 5908 words, continuing toward the planned target range.
