# Summary of Final Integration and Consistency Pass

## Overview
Completed final integration tasks: ensured terminology consistency, added modest empirical burden acknowledgment in conclusion, and included optional normativity hint to pre-empt reviewer questions.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Terminology Consistency
- Verified consistent use of revised terminology throughout:
  - "Provisional promotion": Appears only in Standing Predicate definition (Section 2.1.3), as appropriate.
  - "Empirical signatures": Used in Section 2.6 for normative brittleness, consistent with context.
  - No inconsistencies found in introduction or conclusion; terms are used precisely where defined.

### 2. Empirical Burden Acknowledgment
- Added to conclusion (Section 8): "While the operationalization of these metrics represents a significant empirical program, even their partial application—as in the worked example of Ptolemaic astronomy—can provide valuable diagnostic insight. Future work will focus on pilot studies to refine these proxy measures."
- This manages reviewer expectations by acknowledging the high empirical bar while emphasizing practical utility and future research focus.

### 3. Normativity Hint (Optional)
- Added to Section 2.6: "These constraints may be understood as emerging from our evolutionary history as a cooperative species or from the logical requirements of stable social coordination."
- Pre-empts potential reviewer question about the source of "deep constraints on sustainable human cooperation" by hinting at evolutionary or logical origins without expanding scope.

## Rationale and Impact
These final touches ensure the manuscript is polished and defensive. Consistency prevents confusion, the empirical acknowledgment demonstrates self-awareness of methodological challenges, and the normativity hint addresses a common philosophical objection proactively. The paper now presents a complete, coherent argument ready for peer review.

## Quality Standards Maintained
- **Defensive Writing**: Anticipates criticisms on empirics and normativity.
- **Conciseness**: Additions are brief and targeted.
- **Philosophical Precision**: Normativity hint remains suggestive, not definitive.
- **Scholarly Tone**: Maintains humility while reinforcing ambition.

Total changes: 3 targeted additions, completing the revision process.
