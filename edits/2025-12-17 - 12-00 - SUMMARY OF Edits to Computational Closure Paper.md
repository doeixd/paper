## Changes Made

### 1. Addressed the Scale Objection to Landauer’s Principle (Section 2.1)
- **Location:** Replaced the "A Note on Entropy and Energy" paragraph in Section 2.1.
- **Old Text:** A longer paragraph explaining the distinction between information-theoretic and thermodynamic quantities, acknowledging the negligible micro-scale cost of bit erasure but emphasizing cumulative costs.
- **New Text:** "While the erasure of a single bit costs negligible energy at the micro-scale, the maintenance of a high-fidelity internal model against a shifting environment requires the continuous processing of massive information streams. At the macro-scale, this 'information processing cost' scales up into metabolic and economic overhead. The 'heat' generated by a failing belief system is not just molecular motion; it is the wasted effort of bureaucrats, the friction of enforcement, and the cognitive load of dissonance. Landauer provides the floor; complexity scaling provides the ceiling."
- **Rationale:** The original text was clear but could be more direct in preempting the common objection that Landauer's limit is too small to explain macro-level failures like totalitarian states. The new text explicitly distinguishes micro-thermodynamics from macro-functional costs, maintaining the causal link while grounding the argument in concrete examples (bureaucrats, enforcement friction, cognitive dissonance). This strengthens the paper's defensibility against scientific objections by showing how microscopic costs scale up to tangible societal inefficiencies. Removed boldface from "metabolic and economic overhead" to adhere to guidelines limiting boldface to lists or pseudo-headings. The edit makes the writing more concise and authoritative without overconfidence, while preserving philosophical precision and appropriate qualifications.

## Overall Assessment
- **Alignment with Guidelines:** The edit enhances clarity, concision, and anticipatory defense against objections, aligning with CLAUDE.md preferences for simple, detailed writing that preempts misunderstandings. No other significant improvements were needed, as the paper already follows the style guidelines well (no unnecessary jargon, appropriate citations, measured tone, etc.).
- **Impact on Argument:** This change makes the core thermodynamic-epistemic link more resilient to criticism, potentially increasing the paper's acceptance in philosophy of mind and naturalized epistemology circles.
- **No Additional Changes:** After review, no other sections required edits for better alignment with preferences. The paper maintains existing qualifications, defenses, and citations appropriately.
