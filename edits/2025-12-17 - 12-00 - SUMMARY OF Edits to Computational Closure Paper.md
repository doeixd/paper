## Changes Made

### 1. Addressed the Scale Objection to Landauer’s Principle (Section 2.1)
- **Location:** Revised the "A Note on Entropy and Energy" paragraph in Section 2.1 to integrate the suggested text while preserving all original details.
- **Old Text:** The original paragraph distinguishing quantities, Landauer principle, negligible micro-costs, cumulative implications, tangible costs, functional link, and thermodynamic grounding.
- **New Text:** Integrated version that retains the full distinction between information-theoretic and thermodynamic quantities, the functional vs. metaphorical link, and resource constraints grounding, while adding the explicit response to the scale objection with concrete examples of macro-scale costs (bureaucratic waste, enforcement friction, cognitive dissonance) and the floor/ceiling metaphor.
- **Rationale:** Ensured no details were removed by combining the original comprehensive explanation with the suggested concise response to the objection. This preempts the criticism that Landauer's limit is irrelevant to macro-phenomena by explicitly bridging micro-thermodynamics to macro-functional costs, maintaining the causal link and grounding in thermodynamics. The revision enhances defensibility without losing philosophical precision or qualifications, aligning with CLAUDE.md's emphasis on maximum detail and clarity while keeping concise.

## Overall Assessment
- **Alignment with Guidelines:** The edit enhances clarity, concision, and anticipatory defense against objections, aligning with CLAUDE.md preferences for simple, detailed writing that preempts misunderstandings. No other significant improvements were needed, as the paper already follows the style guidelines well (no unnecessary jargon, appropriate citations, measured tone, etc.).
- **Impact on Argument:** This change makes the core thermodynamic-epistemic link more resilient to criticism, potentially increasing the paper's acceptance in philosophy of mind and naturalized epistemology circles.
- **No Additional Changes:** After review, no other sections required edits for better alignment with preferences. The paper maintains existing qualifications, defenses, and citations appropriately.
