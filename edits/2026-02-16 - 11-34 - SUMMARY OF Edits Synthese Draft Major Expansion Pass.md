## Scope

Major expansion and restructuring pass on `real-patterns-need-closure-SYNTHESE.md` to implement the Synthese plan beyond the initial scaffold draft.

## What Changed

1. Rewrote the manuscript as a fuller argument-first draft.
   - Expanded from a brief scaffold to a sustained paper structure with clearer section-level argumentative roles.

2. Strengthened introduction and novelty framing.
   - Added explicit novelty positioning relative to Dennett, formal closure work, and interventionist pragmatism.
   - Added explicit scope boundaries and non-claims to control overreach.

3. Deepened criterion and admissibility framework.
   - Clarified predictive and interventional readings as complementary tests.
   - Expanded admissibility hierarchy and anti-circular procedural ordering.
   - Kept prior-sensitivity commitments explicit.

4. Strengthened exact and approximate closure sections.
   - Clarified strong lumpability as benchmark rather than whole claim.
   - Expanded graded closure treatment with leakiness target, proxy relation, procedural safeguards, and projectibility check.

5. Upgraded objections section.
   - Expanded instrumentalism, admissibility-circularity, and causal-exclusion replies with stronger reviewer-facing formulations.
   - Preserved bounded handling of Markov and abstract-object objections.

6. Refined conclusion.
   - Reframed contribution as selective commitment under fixed constraints.
   - Kept explicit limits and anti-overreach posture.

## Rationale

The goal of this pass was to move from skeleton to credible submission draft trajectory while preserving the plan's discipline: philosophy first, formalism supportive, scope bounded, and objections handled at reviewer strength.
