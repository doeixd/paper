# Summary: Structural Density Reduction on Synthese Draft

**Date:** 2026-02-16
**File:** `real-patterns-need-closure-SYNTHESE.md`

## Motivation

Review of the full draft identified structural over-density: too many subsections in §2 (14) and §4 (12), several overlapping in content, and a conditional-commitment point restated five times across the paper. The goal was to reduce heading count and echo without losing any defenses, pre-emptions, or philosophical content.

## Changes Made

### Section 2 (reduced from 14 to 11 subsections)

1. **Folded §2.5 (Commitment Transparency) into §2.4.** The 3-line commitment transparency content was a restatement of §1.1's conditional structure. Removed the standalone heading; the point is already established in the introduction and the §5 standing commitments paragraph.

2. **Merged §2.14 (Why Closure Is Not Merely an Epistemic Score) into §2.9 (Why Closure Carries Ontological Weight).** Both sections answered the same question ("isn't closure just a modeling convenience?") from different angles: §2.10 from structural realism commitments, §2.14 from interventional indexing. The merged section now flows: structural realism case → bare structure/Newman → good variable → epistemic-score worry → epistemic humility distinction. All arguments preserved.

3. **Removed §2.12 (Criterion Summary Before Formal Benchmark) as standalone subsection.** Kept the three-line summary content as the closing paragraph of §2.11 (Underdetermination), where it serves as a natural transition into §3. Removed the redundant "decorative add-on" sentence that restated the underdetermination point.

### Section 4 (reduced from 12 to 10 subsections)

4. **Folded §4.9 (Why Computational Adequacy Is Not Enough) into §4.7 (Stable Versus Merely Entailed Patterns).** The computational adequacy point (4 lines) is a natural extension of the stable-vs-entailed distinction: entailed patterns can be computationally adequate without meeting closure. Content preserved as closing sentences of §4.7.

5. **Merged §4.12 (From Diagnostics to Warranted Commitment) into §4.10 (Reporting Discipline, renamed "Reporting and Evidential Discipline").** Both sections covered how to evaluate and report closure evidence. The merged section now flows: reporting structure → assessment sequence → evidential logic → diagnostic set → triangulation recipe. All content preserved.

### Echo reduction

6. **Cut 2 of 5 conditional-commitment restatements.** The "under structural realism, closure suffices; without those commitments, the narrower anti-gerrymandering result still follows" point appeared at: §1.1, §2.9, §5 standing commitments, and §5.6. Removed from §2.9 (where the surrounding "good variable" paragraph already makes the positive case) and §5.6 (where the standing commitments paragraph already covers it). Kept §1.1 and §5 standing commitments as the two canonical locations per the plan's guidance.

### Renumbering

Fixed all subsection numbers to be sequential after merges (§2.5-2.11, §4.1-4.10). Fixed "Third" → "Second" in §5.6 after removing the first consequence point.

## What Was Preserved

- All philosophical arguments and defenses
- All pre-emptions (Newman triviality, bare structure, epistemic-score worry, underdetermination)
- All procedural safeguards and reporting requirements
- All diagnostic content and triangulation recipe
- The conditional commitment structure (in its two canonical locations)

## Net Effect

- 5 fewer subsection headings (14→11 in §2, 12→10 in §4)
- ~200 fewer words
- No content loss
- Paper moves forward faster through §2 and §4
