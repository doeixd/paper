## Scope

Removed the appendix from `real-patterns-need-closure-SYNTHESE.md` and integrated its useful content into the main argument, as requested.

## What Changed

1. Expanded Section 4.11 (`Reporting Discipline`).
   - Added an explicit four-step assessment sequence (specify candidates, fix constraints and diagnostics in advance, evaluate comparatively, report verdict and sensitivity).
   - Framed this sequence as part of epistemic discipline rather than optional implementation detail.

2. Expanded Section 4.12 (`From Diagnostics to Warranted Commitment`).
   - Added a compact domain-general diagnostic triad:
     - leakiness proxy,
     - within-class transition divergence,
     - intervention-response invariance.
   - Added explicit convergence/disagreement interpretation for warrant, revision, and downgrade.

3. Removed `Appendix A: Minimal Evaluation Protocol` entirely.
   - Deleted appendix decision schema, diagnostics list, and failure-trigger list after integrating their substantive content into Section 4.

## Rationale

This revision keeps the paper philosophy-first in structure while preserving procedural rigor where it supports conceptual claims. It also reduces structural overhead and aligns with the preference to avoid appendices.
