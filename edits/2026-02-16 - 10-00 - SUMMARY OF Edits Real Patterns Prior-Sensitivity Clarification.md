## Scope

Small targeted clarification pass in `real-patterns-as-closure.md` to address readers who do not share the paper's full metaphysical priors.

## Changes

1. Added a commitment-transparency paragraph in Section 2.2.
   - States the argument's conditional structure explicitly.
   - Clarifies that readers can accept a narrower conclusion even if they reject structural-realist sufficiency.

2. Added a narrowing sentence in Section 9.2.
   - Clarifies that, for readers with different priors, closure still functions as a necessary anti-gerrymandering condition on macro-ontology claims.

## Rationale

These edits reduce the risk of reader misalignment and prevent avoidable pushback from alternative metaphysical starting points. They preserve the paper's primary thesis while making the fallback commitment explicit.
