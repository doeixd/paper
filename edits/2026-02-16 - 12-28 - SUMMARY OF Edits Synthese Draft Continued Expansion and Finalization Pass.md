## Scope

Continued improvement pass on `real-patterns-need-closure-SYNTHESE.md` focused on deeper argumentation in Sections 2 and 5, followed by release verification.

## What Was Improved

1. Added new Section 2.13 (`Closure, Underdetermination, and Objecthood Discipline`).
   - Clarifies staged filtering from descriptive fit to transition autonomy to robustness.
   - Explains why underdetermination weakens as closure constraints become stricter.

2. Added new Section 2.14 (`Why Closure Is Not Merely an Epistemic Score`).
   - Clarifies closure as intervention-indexed modal evidence rather than observer-side convenience.
   - Strengthens bridge from epistemic success to ontological discipline.

3. Deepened Section 5.1.
   - Added explicit distinction between two instrumentalist pressures (utility-only and anti-ontology versions).
   - Clarified how closure enforces commitment discipline without maximal realism.

4. Deepened Section 5.2.
   - Added clarification that non-redundancy is tied to intervention-guiding difference-making, not semantic convenience.
   - Clarified target-indexed truth/indispensability relation under microphysical completeness.

5. Deepened Section 5.6.
   - Reorganized into three clearer consequences (commitment structure, bounded methodological role, internal failure logic).
   - Added explicit summary line on confidence increase/pause/retreat logic.

6. Deepened Section 5.7.
   - Added burden-of-proof rule for horizon choice and anti-salvage constraints.
   - Clarified downgrade logic when robustness fails.

## Build Verification

Ran:

`python scripts/release.py real-patterns-need-closure-SYNTHESE.md --format typst --output releases/real-patterns-need-closure-SYNTHESE.pdf`

Result:

- Release succeeded.
- Output updated at `releases/real-patterns-need-closure-SYNTHESE.pdf`.
- Backup created at `backups/real-patterns-need-closure-SYNTHESE_20260216_122821.pdf`.

## Status

Word count increased from roughly 7121 to roughly 8131. The draft is substantially stronger and closer to plan targets, with remaining growth likely needed if strict 9000+ word budgeting is maintained.
