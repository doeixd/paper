## Scope

Integrated a targeted referee-preemption pass into `real-patterns-need-closure-SYNTHESE.md` using selective suggestions from external review notes.

## Main Revisions

1. Clarified horizon target in formal statement (Section 2.2).
   - Explicitly states that closure is indexed to the declared $L$-step path distribution, not only one-step prediction.

2. Strengthened admissibility anti-circularity and anti-naturalness handling (Section 2.7).
   - Added explicit rule that interventions preserving partition labels by stipulation are inadmissible.
   - Added a compact admissibility vignette showing downgrade when closure is template-sensitive across nearby defensible intervention classes.

3. Added explicit structural-triviality preemption (Section 2.10).
   - Clarifies why modal/interventional closure is not vulnerable to purely extensional recoding worries.

4. Strengthened formal toy-example interpretation (Section 3.1).
   - Added sentence linking Partition B to high-maintenance predictive bookkeeping, connecting formal contrast to the philosophical target.

5. Added explicit distinction from causal-state equivalence (new Section 3.4).
   - Distinguishes observational predictive equivalence from intervention-indexed closure with robustness/downgrade discipline.

6. Clarified leakiness interpretation stance (Section 4.2).
   - Added sentence that leakiness is interpreted comparatively and via robustness checks.
   - Added explicit downgrade trigger when rank ordering is highly sensitive to modest defensible modeling choices.

7. Strengthened distributed illustration with implementation-collapse case (Section 4.5).
   - Added compact failure case where formal representation persists but implementation channels degrade.
   - Added sentence bracketing broader social ontology debates.

8. Added explicit cheap-coding preemption in objections (Section 5.1).
   - States directly that local recoding gains do not survive closure under admissible perturbations.

## Rationale

This pass addresses likely Synthese referee concerns without scope drift: admissibility doing hidden work, closure-versus-causal-state confusion, leakiness interpretation ambiguity, and permissiveness via cheap recoding.

## Status

Word count increased to roughly 8570, improving alignment with the planned target range while keeping a criterion-first philosophical structure.
