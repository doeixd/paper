## Scope

This pass focused on readability and legibility for recently added reviewer-response edits in `real-patterns-as-closure.md`.

## What Was Revised

1. Shortened dense contribution framing in Section 1.1.
   - Kept the same substantive claim (metaphysical criterion plus audit protocol).
   - Reduced clause stacking and simplified sentence shape.

2. Simplified the computational-mechanics bridge in Section 3.2.
   - Broke a long sentence sequence into shorter, linear steps.
   - Preserved the distinction between ideal target condition (Rosas) and non-ideal application.

3. Rewrote the state-enrichment paragraph in Section 3.2 for clarity.
   - Retained all core commitments: non-Markov compatibility, enriched state legitimacy, pre-specification, and minimality.
   - Split one highly dense paragraph into shorter units to improve readability.

4. Smoothed the pluralism paragraph in Section 4.4.
   - Preserved the constraint-determined framing.
   - Split long sentences to improve pacing and reduce ambiguity.

## Rationale

The intent was purely editorial: improve clarity and legibility while preserving philosophical precision and the paper's determinacy-first stance.
