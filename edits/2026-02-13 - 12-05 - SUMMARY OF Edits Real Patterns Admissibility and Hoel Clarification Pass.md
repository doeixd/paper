# Summary of Edits

## Scope

Ran a targeted revision pass on `real-patterns-as-closure.md` after cross-checking related EPC manuscripts, with focus on intervention-admissibility load-bearing role, relation to Hoel-style causal emergence, and social-kinds scope pressure.

## What Changed

1. Strengthened admissibility role in the introduction by stating explicitly that admissibility constraints are part of the ontological criterion, not optional heuristics.
2. Added an admissibility protocol in Section 3.3 with three explicit pre-diagnostic checks:
   - realizable control channel,
   - regime preservation,
   - invariance relevance.
   If a class fails any check, it is excluded from ontology assessment.
3. Added explicit positioning paragraph in Section 8.2 on relation to Hoel et al. (effective information):
   - alignment in motivation,
   - difference in criterion emphasis (admissible intervention closure + robustness),
   - effective-information gains treated as corroborating diagnostics rather than sole test.
4. Added a social-kinds caveat paragraph in conclusion:
   - recursive recognition can help sustain closure constraints,
   - framework remains applicable but demands extra care in admissibility and implementation specification.

## Rationale

- These edits address the strongest remaining reviewer vulnerability: that intervention-class admissibility is underspecified relative to the argument's dependence on it.
- They also reduce risk of misclassification as a restatement of existing causal-emergence metrics while preserving compatibility.
- The social-kinds note acknowledges the hardest extension domain without overclaiming present coverage.

## Style and Standards

- No em dashes introduced.
- No pseudo-quantification introduced.
- LaTeX variable formatting preserved.
