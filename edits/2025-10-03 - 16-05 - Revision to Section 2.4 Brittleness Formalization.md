# Revision to Section 2.4 Brittleness Formalization

## Summary of Changes

Revised the opening paragraph of Section 2.4 in paper.md to address potential reviewer concerns about overconfidence in formalization and over-mathematization. The changes emphasize humility in the model's completeness, reframe the formula as illustrative and heuristic, and proactively address objections about mathematization in a philosophical context.

## Key Edits

- Replaced "While a complete formalization remains an empirical research program, we can represent brittleness as a composite function" with "To avoid overconfidence in formalization, we note that a complete quantitative model remains a goal for empirical research rather than a settled achievement. For illustrative purposes, brittleness might be represented as a composite function of its components"
- Changed "An initial exploration might use a form capturing multiplicative compounding while recognizing resilience" to "A speculative form could capture potential compounding effects"
- Modified "where the parameters α, β, γ, δ are empirically determinable via historical data analysis, not philosophical stipulations" to "where parameters α, β, γ, δ would need empirical determination through historical analysis, not a priori stipulation. Reviewers might worry this risks over-mathematization in a philosophical context; we emphasize that the formula is heuristic, not prescriptive, and serves only to clarify the interdependent nature of the indicators"

## Rationale

These changes maintain the core content while adding qualifications to avoid grandiose claims about formalization. The addition of the reviewer objection pre-empts criticism and reinforces the paper's defensive, humble tone. The language shifts from "we can represent" to "might be represented" and from "determinable" to "would need empirical determination" to emphasize fallibility and the speculative nature of the formula. This aligns with the writing guidelines of being authoritative without overconfidence, complex without unnecessary density, and anticipatory of objections.
