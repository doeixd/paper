# Summary of Terminology Consistency Fix in proc_v7.md

## Date and Time
2025-10-07 - 01-00

## Overview
This edit session addressed inconsistencies in terminology between final.md and proc_v7.md, specifically standardizing the term for the domain of multiple viable solutions from "Pluralist Periphery" to "Pluralist Frontier" to match final.md. Also verified consistency of "Brittleness" usage.

## Key Findings
- **Pluralist Frontier/Periphery:** final.md uses "Pluralist Frontier" throughout (e.g., Section 4.4). proc_v7.md inconsistently used "Pluralist Periphery" in Section 4.3 and "Pluralist Frontier" in Section 5.5. Changed all instances to "Pluralist Frontier" for consistency.
- **Brittleness:** Both papers consistently use "brittleness" (often "systemic brittleness" or "Systemic Brittleness Index"). No changes needed.

## Specific Changes Made

### 1. Standardized "Pluralist Frontier" in proc_v7.md
**Replaced all instances of "Pluralist Periphery" with "Pluralist Frontier"**

**Locations changed:**
- Section 4.3: Changed "Pluralist Periphery" to "Pluralist Frontier"
- Section 5.6: Already used "Pluralist Frontier", no change needed

**Rationale:** To match final.md's consistent usage of "Pluralist Frontier" and eliminate internal inconsistency within proc_v7.md.

## Overall Assessment
Terminology is now fully consistent between the papers. "Brittleness" was already consistent. No other term inconsistencies found. The change improves integration and avoids confusion for readers.

## No Deleted Information
No content was deleted; only terminology standardized.
