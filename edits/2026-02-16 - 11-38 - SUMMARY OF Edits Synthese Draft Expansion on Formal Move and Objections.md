## Scope

Continued expansion pass on `real-patterns-need-closure-SYNTHESE.md` to improve argumentative depth while preserving scope discipline.

## Main Additions

1. Added a compact formal illustration in Section 3.1.
   - Introduced a minimal symbolic partition contrast to show how closure discriminates between legitimate and gerrymandered macro-candidates.
   - Purpose: make the anti-gerrymandering move explicit without turning the paper into a technical methods text.

2. Added Section 4.7 on stable versus merely entailed patterns.
   - Clarified that trajectory truth alone is not enough for objecthood.
   - Reinforced stability and interventional robustness as the decisive standards.

3. Added two reviewer-facing objections in Section 5.
   - New 5.7: predictive success does not imply existence.
   - New 5.8: philosophy versus methods-note concern.
   - Both replies preserve the paper's two-level commitment structure and criterion-first framing.

## Rationale

These additions strengthen likely Synthese referee pressure points, improve explanatory continuity between formal and philosophical sections, and keep the manuscript aligned with the plan's requirement for explicit, non-overreaching argumentative moves.
