# Synthese Draft Submission-Readiness Pass

**Date:** 2026-02-17
**File:** `real-patterns-need-closure-SYNTHESE.md`

## Summary

Comprehensive consolidation and polish pass to prepare the Synthese version for submission. No new arguments added; existing arguments tightened and de-duplicated.

## Changes

### 1. Introduction: Lewis Contrast Added
Added a brief paragraph using Lewis's canonical mereological-sum example ("the right half of my left shoe plus the moon...," Lewis 1986, 213) as a foil against the hurricane case. The point: Lewis is right that arbitrary sums exist, but the paper's question is different. It asks which composites qualify as macro-objects with autonomous transition structure. This makes the permissiveness gap concrete before the thesis statement lands.

**Rationale:** The intro previously jumped from abstract problem statement to thesis with no intuitive anchor. Synthese reviewers benefit from a vivid contrast that isolates the exact variable under discussion.

### 2. Gladziejewski (2025) Citation Integrated
Added a short paragraph in Section 1.1 connecting the closure criterion to recent cognitive-origins work on real patterns (Gladziejewski 2025, published in Synthese). The closure criterion is positioned as complementary: cognitive accounts explain why bounded agents converge on certain macro-descriptions, but representational success alone does not settle macro-objecthood without a further transition-autonomy test.

**Rationale:** Engages the journal's own recent literature. Strengthens anti-arbitrariness defense. Citation was already in references.md.

### 3. Section 3.3 Merged into 2.3
The old Section 3.3 ("Compression and Closure Are Related but Not Identical") was near-identical to Section 2.3 ("Why This is More Than Compression"). Deleted 3.3 entirely; all unique content was already covered in 2.3. Renumbered subsequent section (3.4 became 3.3).

**Rationale:** A reviewer would notice the same distinction stated twice in close proximity. Kills the highest-priority redundancy.

### 4. Section 3.3 (formerly 3.4) Meta-Commentary Trimmed
Removed the defensive opening question ("why this paper is needed"), the closing summary paragraph, and shortened the causal-emergence comparison. The four-point differentiation (intervention indexing, ontological interpretation, graded commitment, anti-gerrymandering argument) is preserved intact.

**Rationale:** The novelty case is already made in Sections 1.1 and 1.4. Restating it in Section 3 reads as defensive. Trust the argument.

### 5. Section 2.6 (Admissibility Disputes) Condensed
Removed the storm vignette (3 sentences), the template-classes paragraph, and "this is a strength, not a weakness" self-congratulatory framing. Kept the adjudication rule, the label-targeting inadmissibility guardrail, and the plural-testing point.

**Rationale:** The procedural point is straightforward. Over-explaining wastes reviewer patience.

### 6. Conclusion Tightened
Merged three paragraphs into two, removing triple restatement of the permissiveness fix. The conclusion now opens with the core move, states what the framework buys, and closes with limits and future directions.

**Rationale:** The conclusion previously said "permissiveness" three times in close succession. One clear statement is more authoritative.

### 7. Section 4.6 Numbering Fixed
Changed "Three failure patterns" to "Four failure patterns" to match the four items actually listed.

### 8. Abstract Sharpened
Rewrote to lead with Dennett and the permissiveness diagnosis, then the closure solution, then scope. Cut the final sentence about "audit protocol" and "estimator engineering." Tighter and more compelling.

### 9. Section 5.3 Reply Developed
Added a conceptual punchline to the autonomy-vs-closure reply: "Generic autonomy claims assert that higher levels matter. Closure specifies when they matter, how much they matter (graded by leakiness), and when the claim should be withdrawn. A realism criterion without withdrawal conditions is not a criterion at all. It is an assertion."

**Rationale:** The objection "this is just autonomy with a new name" is predictable. The previous reply was procedural; it needed a philosophical punchline.

### 10. References Updated
- Added Lewis 1986 to paper's reference list and to `references.md`
- Added Gladziejewski 2025 to paper's reference list (already in `references.md`)

## What Was Preserved
- All existing citations and qualifications
- All formal machinery (criterion statement, lemma, proof sketch, toy example)
- All objection-reply pairs
- The graded commitment structure (robust/qualified/indeterminate)
- The Newman triviality reply and all intervention-indexing arguments

## Net Effect
- ~30 lines removed (redundancy, meta-commentary, self-congratulatory framing)
- ~15 lines added (Lewis contrast, Gladziejewski paragraph, autonomy punchline)
- Net reduction of ~15 lines
- Two new references added (Lewis 1986, Gladziejewski 2025)
- Paper is tighter, less repetitive, and better positioned for Synthese review
