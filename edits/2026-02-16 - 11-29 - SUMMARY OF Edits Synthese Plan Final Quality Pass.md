## Scope

Final quality pass on `real-patterns-need-closure-SYNTHESE-PLAN.md` to improve operational usefulness for drafting and submission readiness.

## Improvements Added

1. Added section-level word-budget guidance to enforce scope discipline.
2. Added red-line scope rules to prevent common expansion and drift risks.
3. Added a stable three-sentence novelty script for abstract and introduction consistency.
4. Added a desk-reject prevention checklist focused on Synthese editorial expectations.

## Rationale

The plan already had strong philosophical guidance. This pass made it more executable by adding concrete constraints and repeatable framing tools that reduce ambiguity during drafting and revision.
