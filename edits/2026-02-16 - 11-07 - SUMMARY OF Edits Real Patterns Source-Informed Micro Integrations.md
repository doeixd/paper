## Scope

This pass integrated a small subset of source-informed suggestions from Dennett (1991), Ladyman and Ross (2007), and Rosas et al. (2024), while preserving the paper's current architecture and tone.

## What Changed

1. Clarified that macro-level coarse-graining is not restricted to spatial contiguity.
   - Added language in Section 5.1 that coarse-graining is logical and dynamical, not necessarily spatial.
   - This supports distributed social and institutional examples already used later in the paper.

2. Added a projectibility guardrail for regime specification.
   - Added language in Section 5.1 that defensible regimes must support stable induction under modest counterfactual variation.
   - Clarified why gerrymandered regime definitions fail under slight context shifts.

3. Refined borderline-case interpretation in Section 7.3.
   - Added a short distribution-conditional closure clarification for candle-flame style cases.
   - This gives a more precise account of why closure can hold in stable conditions and degrade under perturbation.

4. Strengthened the Martian reply in Section 9.1 with a bounded compression point.
   - Added that closed macro-partitions can provide a better information bottleneck for target macro-dynamics.
   - Framed this as representational burden reduction, not as an overclaim about metaphysical superiority.

5. Strengthened Section 9.5 (causal exclusion) with computational autonomy language.
   - Added a Rosas-linked point: closure supports macro-level computational autonomy for target dynamics.
   - Clarified that this establishes explanatory/control non-redundancy without denying microphysical implementation.

## Rationale

The objective was resilience, not expansion. These edits tighten existing claims against common reviewer objections while avoiding new named concepts, avoiding overstatement, and keeping the paper's core thesis unchanged.
