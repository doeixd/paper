# Summary of Edits

## Scope

Started a new manuscript draft at `closure-as-real-pattern.md` based on the requested outline for a publishable philosophy of science and metaphysics-adjacent paper.

## What Changed

1. Added a full first-pass structure with title, abstract, and Sections 1-9.
2. Implemented the paper's central move explicitly: one closure concept with two sources (stipulated and induced).
3. Built the argument around a three-level ladder (reality, patterns, representations) to prevent category-mixing.
4. Added a separate section on implementation versus representation, so dependence claims do not collapse into anti-realism.
5. Included conceptual illustrations for chess, mathematics, hurricanes and organisms, and English and law.
6. Added an objections-and-replies section that directly targets likely reviewer criticism (instrumentalism, mind dependence, equivocation, over-breadth).
7. Kept the formal machinery subordinate to the philosophical argument while still anchoring induced closure in computational-mechanics literature.

## Rationale

- The immediate goal was to establish a resilient argumentative spine before expanding technical or historical detail.
- The draft prioritizes clear inferential sequencing, so each section hands off to the next without conceptual jumps.
- The text avoids pseudo-quantification and treats examples as conceptual illustrations rather than empirical proof.
- The structure is designed to reduce foreseeable reviewer objections by disambiguating ontology, implementation, and representation early.

## Citation Handling

- Used citations already present in the repository's bibliography: Dennett (1991), Shalizi and Crutchfield (2001), Rosas et al. (2024), and Woodward (2003).
- No new bibliography entries were required for this draft stage.

## Next Recommended Steps

1. Tighten the abstract to the target journal word limit if needed.
2. Expand Section 6 with one compact worked closure example for the induced case.
3. Add a short paragraph in Section 8 clarifying exactly what would count as failure conditions for the framework.
4. Align section language with whichever target journal's citation and heading conventions you want to submit under.
