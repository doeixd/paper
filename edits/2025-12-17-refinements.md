# Refinements to *Computational Closure and the Architecture of Mind*

## Summary of Changes
1.  **Removing Em-Dashes**: Systematically replaced em-dashes (`—`) with colons, semicolons, commas, or parentheses to comply with `CLAUDE.md` guidelines.
2.  **Reducing Boldface**: Removed excessive bolding of terms (e.g., "**Markov Blankets**", "**Computational Closure**") in body text, lists, and definitions. Used italics for initial definitions or emphasis where appropriate.
3.  **Introduction & Flow**:
    *   Refined the opening paragraph to improve sentence flow.
    *   Clarified the distinction between "statistical patterns" and "structural patterns".
    *   Reworded the "Conceptual Roadmap" to be a narrative paragraph rather than a list.
4.  **Terminological Refinements**:
    *   Standardized casing for terms like "logical depth", "strong lumpability", etc.
    *   Clarified the "Phlogiston" and "Quarks" examples in the Markov blanket section.
5.  **Section 1 & 2**:
    *   Removed bolding in the list of free energy minimization strategies.
    *   Fixed the cross-reference to "Section 2.5" (was "Section 1.5").
6.  **Moral/Ethical Sections**:
    *   Formatted the "Constitutive Defense" and "Instrumental Defense" as an italicized list items rather than bolded headers.

## Motivation
These edits aim to elevate the academic tone, improve readability, and ensure strict adherence to the formatting guidelines specified in `CLAUDE.md`.
