## Specific Changes Made

### High-Impact Revisions (Strengthening the Core Argument)

1. **Causal Chain in Diagnostic Tiers (Section 2.2)**
   - **Added:** Concluding sentence explaining the causal cascade between tiers.
   - **Rationale:** Transforms the tiered framework from a static list into a dynamic process, enhancing argumentative power.

   - **Revised:** Rephrased to directly collapse one horn of Street's dilemma, emphasizing that moral truth supervenes on pragmatic viability.
   - **Rationale:** Makes the reply more forceful and philosophically precise.

### Refinements for Clarity and Consistency

3. **Replaced Old Term (Section 4.4)**
   - **Changed:** "First-Order Costs" to "Tier 1 Bio-Social Costs" for consistency.
   - **Rationale:** Eliminates lingering inconsistency with the updated terminology.

4. **Enhanced Empirical Grounding for Patriarchy Case (Section 3.3)**

5. **Small Retitling for Precision (Section 4.3)**
   - **Changed Title:** From "Moral Knowledge Structure" to "The Structure of the Viable Normative Landscape: The `Floor` and the `Ceiling`".
   - **Rationale:** Aligns title more accurately with content describing the objective landscape.

### Polishing and Professionalism

6. **Strengthened Scope Section Conclusion (Section 1.3)**
   - **Revised:** Made phrasing more active and focused on "building" the model.
   - **Rationale:** Increases impact and rhetorical power.
