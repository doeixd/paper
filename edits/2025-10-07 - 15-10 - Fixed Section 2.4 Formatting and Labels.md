# Fixed Section 2.4 Formatting and Labels

## Summary of Changes

Improved the formatting and structure of section 2.4 "Operationalizing Brittleness: A Worked Example" in proc_v7.md by converting bold labels into proper sub-sub-headers.

## Specific Changes

### Before (Inconsistent formatting with bold text):
```
**Measuring C(t): The Coercion Ratio.** [paragraph text]
**Measuring P(t): Patch Velocity.** [paragraph text]
**Measuring Tier 1 Bio-Social Costs.** [paragraph text]
**Triangulated Diagnosis.** [paragraph text]
```

### After (Proper hierarchical headers):
```
#### Measuring C(t): The Coercion Ratio
[paragraph text]

#### Measuring P(t): Patch Velocity
[paragraph text]

#### Measuring Tier 1 Bio-Social Costs
[paragraph text]

#### Triangulated Diagnosis
[paragraph text]
```

## Rationale

1. **Improved Structure**: Converting bold labels to #### headers creates proper document hierarchy and better navigation
2. **Academic Standards**: Headers provide clearer section breaks and improve readability
3. **Consistency**: All subsections now follow the same formatting pattern
4. **Accessibility**: Screen readers and document processors better recognize header structure

## Impact

- Enhanced document structure and readability
- Better compliance with academic paper formatting standards
- Improved navigation and section identification
- No content changes, only formatting improvements
