## Scope

This was a light polish pass focused on prose quality rather than conceptual change. The goal was to improve readability, flow, and sentence rhythm while preserving all major arguments and defenses.

## Edits Made

1. **Abstract cleanup**
   - Removed trailing ellipsis in the Causal Closure sentence for a more formal academic cadence.

2. **Methodology section clarity**
   - Tightened and split a dense paragraph in the introduction to reduce clause stacking and improve readability.
   - Kept the same diagnostic-not-constitutive claim and structural realist commitment.

3. **Roadmap sentence flow**
   - Smoothed wording in the four-stage roadmap for cleaner transitions and more direct phrasing.

4. **Part 5 formatting/flow fix**
   - Corrected spacing and fused a broken sentence around "predicts equally well" so the logic reads continuously.

5. **Orthogonal dimensions paragraph polish**
   - Reworked sentence structure in the legal-to-physical interaction example.
   - Replaced one overly long sentence with shorter linear steps while preserving the same content.

6. **Scale relativity and heart example tightening**
   - Reduced clause stacking in Section 8 discussion of scale relativity and multi-domain heart descriptions.
   - Preserved the same philosophical claims (closure by intervention class, compatibility across state spaces).

7. **Minor consistency edits**
   - Standardized capitalization in one axis bullet list (quarks/molecules/corporations/minds).

## Rationale

- Improve readability for skeptical reviewers without weakening precision.
- Preserve argument resilience while reducing friction from long or overloaded sentences.
- Keep terminology and claim strength aligned with existing framework.

## Integrity Check

- No new conceptual machinery introduced.
- No citations added/removed.
- No pseudo-quantification added.
- Core claims and qualification structure preserved.
