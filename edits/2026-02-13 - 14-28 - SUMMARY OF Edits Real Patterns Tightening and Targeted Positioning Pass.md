## What changed

- Tightened prose across the main text by removing repeated paper-narration and framework-signposting that did not add argumentative content.
- Condensed repeated methodological reminders in Sections 1, 5, 6, 9, and 10 while preserving scope qualifications and objection-handling structure.
- Expanded the Gładziejewski engagement in Section 1.1 to make the relation explicit: cognitive genealogy helps explain representational convergence, but does not by itself settle macro-objecthood.
- Strengthened the constrained pluralism passage in Section 4.4 by drawing out implications for explanatory competition between levels and target-mismatch disputes.

## Why these edits were made

The manuscript had accumulated density from iterative hardening passes. The goal here was to reduce meta-commentary without removing core defenses. The revisions keep the argument's logical sequence intact while improving pace and readability.

The Gładziejewski discussion was also at risk of appearing tokenistic. The revised paragraph now situates that program as a genuine ally on anti-arbitrariness while clarifying the remaining ontological question addressed by closure.

The constrained pluralism section now does more philosophical work. It explains why apparent cross-level explanatory rivalry often reflects different intervention targets, and it states when direct ranking is appropriate.

## Resilience checks

- Preserved all major qualifications on regime, horizon, intervention class, and graded verdicts.
- Preserved anti-instrumentalism and anti-permissiveness defenses.
- Kept examples framed as conceptual illustrations, not stand-alone empirical proof.
- Maintained style constraints (no em dashes, measured tone, no unnecessary jargon).

## Outcome

- Main-text word count reduced by roughly 640 words relative to the previous committed version.
- Core thesis and commitment structure remain unchanged.
