## Overview
This session implemented enhancements to make proc_v7.md more intuitive, explanatory, and situated in the literature. Changes focused on onboarding, procedural clarity, illustrative examples, and comparative positioning.

## Specific Changes Made

### 1. Improve Onboarding (Section 1.2)
**Added evocative paragraph with bridge-building analogy:**
"At its heart, this project is based on a simple idea: **moral principles are like engineering designs for social worlds.** Like any design, they can be elegant in theory but flawed in practice. When a bridge design is flawed, it generates stress, cracks, and eventually collapses. When a normative design is flawed—such as one built on slavery—it generates social stress (dissent, rebellion), structural cracks (coercive costs, economic stagnation), and is likewise prone to collapse. Our project is to develop the diagnostic tools to detect these structural flaws in our normative architectures *before* they lead to catastrophic failure."

**Rationale:** Provides an intuitive, memorable analogy early on to ground the complex theory in a concrete mental model.

### 2. Better Explain the "Procedural" (New Subsection 4.1.1)
**Added "The Pragmatic Procedure of Moral Inquiry" with 5-step process:**
"So, what is the 'procedure' in Pragmatic Procedural Realism? It is a multi-stage, iterative process of collective inquiry grounded in historical empirics:

1. **Hypothesis Generation:** Communities propose normative principles ('predicates') as potential solutions to social coordination problems.
2. **Empirical Testing:** These principles are implemented in social systems ('interactors'), where they are subjected to the non-negotiable filter of pragmatic consequences over historical time.
3. **Data Collection & Diagnosis:** We, as inquirers, analyze the historical track record of these systems, using the tiered diagnostic toolkit to measure their brittleness (Tier 1 costs, C(t), P(t)).
4. **Mapping the Landscape:** Through comparative analysis, we identify principles that reliably generate high costs and enter them into the **Negative Canon** (mapping the 'floor'). We also identify principles that repeatedly emerge in low-brittleness systems and add them to the **Convergent Core**.
5. **Revision and Refinement:** Armed with this evolving map, we are better equipped to revise our current normative systems, debugging high-cost principles and engineering more viable alternatives.

This procedure is empirical, fallible, and ongoing. It is the collective, scientific-historical method for discovering the objective contours of the viable normative landscape."

**Rationale:** Makes the "procedure" concrete and actionable, showing it's a genuine research program.

### 3. Enhance Three-Level Account (Section 4.4)
**Wove consistent dueling society example through all levels:**
- **Level 3:** Added example of aristocratic dueling society honor code.
- **Level 2:** Added diagnosis of dueling code's high costs.
- **Level 1:** Added objective wrongness relative to Apex Network.

**Rationale:** Uses a single, continuous example to make abstract distinctions immediately clear and demonstrate practical application.

### 4. Clarify Relationship to Other Projects (Section 5.5)
**Added comparison to Kitcher's Ethical Project:**
"**Objection: How does this differ from Kitcher's 'Ethical Project'?** Reply: Our project shares much with Kitcher's (2011) view of ethics as a social technology for solving problems of altruism. However, EPC offers two crucial advancements. First, it provides a more general diagnostic toolkit (the SBI) that applies equally to scientific and ethical 'technologies,' grounding the project in a unified theory of justification. Second, EPC's concept of the modally necessary Apex Network provides a more robustly realist foundation. Where Kitcher's progress is defined by functional enhancement relative to a historical starting point, our framework grounds progress in convergence toward an objective, mind-independent structure of viability. This offers a stronger defense against charges of historicism or relativism."

**Rationale:** Demonstrates deep engagement with naturalistic ethics literature and highlights specific contributions.

## Overall Assessment
These changes transform the paper from one that is read to one that teaches how to think in this new way. It enhances intuitiveness, clarity, and scholarly positioning without altering core arguments.
