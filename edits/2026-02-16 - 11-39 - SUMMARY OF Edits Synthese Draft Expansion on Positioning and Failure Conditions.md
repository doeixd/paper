## Scope

Continued expansion pass on `real-patterns-need-closure-SYNTHESE.md` to improve dialectical clarity and strengthen criterion-level discipline.

## Main Revisions

1. Added `1.3 Three Nearby Positions`.
   - Clarifies differences between compression-prediction realism, pure pragmatism, and closure realism.
   - Improves argumentative orientation early in the paper.

2. Refined wording in Section 2.3.
   - Replaced awkward phraseing with clearer "macro-level what-follows" language.

3. Added `4.8 Practical Qualification Under Sparse Intervention Access`.
   - Clarifies evidential strategy when direct interventions are limited.
   - Preserves interventional closure as ontological target.

4. Added `4.9 Why Computational Adequacy Is Not Enough`.
   - Sharpens distinction between useful model performance and objecthood qualification.

5. Added `5.9 What Would Count as Failure for This Framework?`.
   - States explicit internal failure/downgrade conditions.
   - Strengthens resilience against "insulation" objections.

6. Strengthened conclusion framing.
   - Added explicit middle-range positioning between permissive realism and total metaphysics.
   - Added bounded future-work direction focused on comparative testing rather than concept proliferation.

## Rationale

This pass improves Synthese-facing readability and reviewer defensibility by making the dialectical map clearer, tightening distinctions, and making failure conditions more explicit without introducing scope creep.
