## Scope

This pass made targeted reductions in repetitive passages while preserving argumentative defenses, technical precision, and existing citation structure.

## Main Edits

1. **Leakiness tolerance subsection compressed**
   - Condensed repeated claims about survival-calibrated tolerance and algorithmic complexity influx into one tighter paragraph.
   - Preserved the three-part structure: exact closure cases, approximate measurable leakage, and survival-selected tolerances.

2. **Rainforest Realism transition tightened**
   - Removed repeated restatements of cross-agent convergence in the lead-in to objections.
   - Kept one concise statement of why vortex-level compression is objective under shared constraints.

3. **Conclusion streamlined**
   - Replaced multiple overlapping restatements with a tighter ending that keeps the same final claims:
     - ontology must track causal-informational structure,
     - nihilism remains formally consistent but explanatorily thin,
     - wholes are non-fundamental yet metaphysically real when closure conditions are met.

## Rationale

- Improved readability by reducing local repetition that did not add new inferential content.
- Maintained reviewer-facing defenses against instrumentalism, task-relativity, and terminological retreat.
- Preserved the paper's measured tone and qualification discipline.

## Style/Policy Checks

- No pseudo-quantification introduced.
- Existing citations and references were left unchanged.
- Revisions stayed within the manuscript's established conceptual framework.
