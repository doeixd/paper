## What changed

- Added explicit critic anchoring for the two central pressure points in the introduction: permissiveness and ontological discipline, now linked to Elgin and Haugeland.
- Expanded the Ladyman and Ross positioning language to make the contrast sharper: preserve realism, add a closure-based pruning condition.
- Added a targeted paragraph in Section 4.2 using the lost-sock-center style challenge as a conceptual foil for the anti-gerrymandering criterion.
- Added an eliminativist-pressure clarification in Section 9.2 to show how closure avoids both naive usefulness realism and reduction-only demands, with Churchland as the key interlocutor.
- Updated the manuscript's selected references with Churchland 1981, Elgin 2017, and Haugeland 1998.
- Added matching Chicago-style entries to `references.md` in alphabetical order.

## Why these edits were made

The paper already claimed to fix instrumentalist drift and permissiveness. This pass makes those claims more reviewer-resilient by tying them to recognizable critics who pressed the same vulnerabilities. The result is a clearer argumentative arc: the paper is not merely proposing a new criterion, it is solving documented problems in the real-patterns literature.

## Scope and style choices

- I integrated these citations in body prose rather than footnotes to comply with project constraints.
- I kept the additions bounded so they strengthen positioning without reopening scope.
- I used the suggested critics as pressure tests, but preserved the paper's own framing and vocabulary to avoid terminological sprawl.

## Resilience check

- Strengthens literature-facing credibility without overclaiming historical exegesis.
- Preserves the core thesis that closure is a stricter macro-objecthood condition layered onto broader pattern realism.
- Maintains concise prose and does not reintroduce heavy meta-commentary.
