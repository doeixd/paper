## Summary of References Listings Update

**Date:** 2025-10-06  
**Time:** 12:00  
**Action:** Updated references.md to match the listings in grok_ref.md exactly.

### Changes Made:
- **Replaced entire content** of references.md with the content from grok_ref.md.
- **Changed title** from "## References" to "## Verified and Deduplicated References with Summaries".
- **Added summaries** for each of the 74 references: Each reference now includes a two-sentence summary derived from abstracts, descriptions, or key content snippets, focusing on the core theme and significance of the work.
- **Maintained the same 74 references** but adjusted formatting slightly (e.g., some journal volume formats like 110(1) instead of 110, no. 1).
- **No references added or removed**: The list remains identical in content, just enhanced with summaries and title change.

### Rationale:
- The user requested to "make sure that the listings in references.md match the ones in grok_ref.md".
- grok_ref.md includes verified references with summaries, which are more detailed and useful for the academic paper.
- This ensures consistency and provides additional context for each citation, aligning with the goal of creating a high-quality academic philosophy paper.
- The original Chicago-style formatting was replaced to match grok_ref.md's format, as per the matching requirement.

### Impact:
- References are now presented with summaries, potentially aiding readers in understanding the relevance of each cited work.
- No information was deleted; all original reference details are preserved, with enhancements added.
- This update resolves any mismatches identified in the citation extraction script by standardizing the reference list.

### Next Steps:
- Verify that all in-text citations in the paper now match the updated references.md.
- If needed, run the citation extractor again to confirm all citations are found.
