## Scope

Integrated additional reviewer-style suggestions into `real-patterns-need-closure-SYNTHESE.md`, with focus on pre-empting misunderstandings while preserving scope discipline.

## Main Revisions

1. Strengthened admissibility transparency in Section 2.7.
   - Added three concrete admissibility template classes (boundary nudges, coarse actuator controls, policy levers).
   - Added explicit downgrade logic when closure appears only under one narrowly tuned template.

2. Added explicit argument beat from closure to objecthood in Section 2.10.
   - Added a direct "why not stop at good variable" paragraph.
   - Clarified closure as evidence of objective modal structure under stated commitments.

3. Clarified metaphysical stance on regime/horizon indexing in Section 4.4.
   - Added sentence that regime and horizon index the modal profile being claimed, not an anything-goes concession.

4. Added concrete non-ideal worked miniature in Section 4.10.
   - Added traffic vignette contrasting stable lane-flow partition with brittle ID-cluster partition under admissible perturbations and horizon extension.

5. Added explicit minimal triangulation recipe in Section 4.12.
   - Requires stability under modest horizon variation and at least two defensible admissibility perturbations, with agreement from at least two diagnostics.
   - Clarifies when robust verdict is not warranted.

## Rationale

These edits directly target likely reviewer misunderstandings without expanding into methods-heavy detail. They make the anti-backfitting claims feel operationally earned and improve the closure-to-objecthood bridge.
