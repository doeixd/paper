# Paper Release and Citation Fixes

## Summary of Changes

Successfully released `final.md` to publication-ready PDF format and resolved all citation matching issues. The paper is now ready for submission with complete, verified references.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Fixed Multi-Author Citation Parsing in paper_converter.py
- **Location**: `extract_citations_from_file()` function, lines 59-89
- **Change**: Enhanced parenthetical citation extraction to handle semicolon-separated and comma-separated author lists
- **Implementation**: Added logic to split citations like `(Olsson 2005; Kvanvig 2012; Krag 2015)` into individual author-year pairs for proper matching
- **Impact**: Resolved 4 previously unmatched citations by correctly parsing complex multi-author references

### 2. Filtered Invalid Citations
- **Location**: `is_valid_citation()` function, line 28
- **Change**: Added "originally" to invalid words list to prevent parsing of reference formatting notes
- **Impact**: Eliminated false positive citations from reference entries

### 3. Successful Paper Release
- **Input**: `final.md` (128,780 bytes)
- **Output**: `releases/final.pdf` (209,424 bytes)
- **Format**: Typst → PDF
- **Citations Processed**: 46 citations extracted, 43 unique references filtered and included
- **Processing Time**: 0.7 seconds
- **Status**: ✅ Complete with no missing citations

## Citation Verification Results
