# Summary of Edits

## Scope

Applied a targeted revision pass to `real-patterns-as-closure.md` based on the latest peer-review report, with emphasis on definitional precision, anti-gerrymandering terminology, operational traceability, and literature positioning.

## Major Changes

1. Added a stipulative definition in the introduction: "gerrymandered" now explicitly means dynamically incoherent/high-leak, not merely intuitively disjunctive.
2. Expanded closure definition with explicit predictive and interventional forms:
   - predictive approximation statement,
   - intervention-indexed stability statement across microstates within a macroclass.
3. Strengthened the related-work paragraph with additional emergence/coarse-graining references (Bedau, Hoel et al., Ladyman & Ross, Mitchell) while keeping scope focused.
4. Added an auditability sentence in the ladder section to justify the fifth rung (representations of instances).
5. Linked the Section 3.5 philosophical discriminant directly to Section 5 diagnostics (kernel divergence and intervention-conditioned $\Delta$), so the bridge is operational rather than hypothetical.
6. Clarified pseudo-code terminology by specifying that "within-class micro features" are features that differentiate microstates mapped to the same macrostate.
7. Tightened Section 7 language further into conditional protocol form to avoid accidental empirical overclaiming.
8. Expanded the selected references list in-paper and kept alphabetical order.

## Rationale

- These edits directly address likely referee concerns about compressed formal definitions and potential rhetoric-method mismatch.
- The paper now reads more consistently as a criterion for dynamic coherence with explicit decision procedures.
- The modifications preserve the core thesis while reducing openings for hostile interpretation.

## Style and Standards

- No em dashes introduced.
- No pseudo-quantified examples introduced.
- Mathematical notation remains in LaTeX delimiters.
