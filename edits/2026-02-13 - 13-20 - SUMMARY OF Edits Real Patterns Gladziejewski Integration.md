# Summary of Edits

## Scope

Integrated the new Gładziejewski (2025) paper into `real-patterns-as-closure.md` to strengthen the representation-versus-implementation distinction and clarify complementarity with predictive-mind accounts.

## Changes Made

1. Added a targeted related-work paragraph in Section 1.1:
   - credits Gładziejewski's cognitive-genealogy account,
   - clarifies that this paper addresses the distinct metaphysical availability question via closure/lumpability.
2. Added a bridging sentence in Section 6.1:
   - MDL-style cohesion explains epistemic model efficiency,
   - closure criteria explain ontological availability under admissible interventions.
3. Added a full in-paper references entry for Gładziejewski (2025) in `## References (selected)`.
4. Added the same reference to `references.md` in alphabetical order.

## Rationale

- Strengthens the paper's positioning as complementary to, not competitive with, predictive-mind patternism.
- Makes the representation flank and implementation/closure flank division explicit for reviewers.
- Improves literature coverage with a directly relevant 2025 source.
