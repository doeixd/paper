# Terminology Clarifications from Propositions-Predicates Analysis
**Date:** 2025-10-03, 14:39

## Summary of Changes

Made small, targeted edits to paper.md to incorporate clarifying insights from propositions_predicates.md, which compared the paper's technical terms with their usage in computer science/formal logic and traditional philosophy.

## Specific Edits

### 1. Section 2.1.1: Clarified "Proposition" (line 35)
**Location:** "From Private Belief to Public Proposition" subsection

**Added:** Explicit acknowledgment that the paper's treatment of "proposition" is deflationary and functional, distinguishing it from the abstract, language-independent philosophical conception.

**Rationale:** The propositions_predicates.md document showed that while philosophy treats propositions as abstract meanings (the same proposition can be expressed in different languages), the paper uses a more concrete, CS-like approach focusing on evaluable statements. Making this explicit prevents reader confusion and clarifies the paper's methodological commitments.

### 2. Section 2.1.3: Enhanced "Standing Predicate" definition (line 45)
**Location:** "From Validated Data to Standing Predicate" subsection

**Added:** Explicit contrast with predicates in formal logic (boolean functions) and philosophy (abstract properties), emphasizing that Standing Predicates earn status through evolutionary filtering.

**Rationale:** The propositions_predicates.md analysis revealed that "Standing Predicate" is the paper's unique contribution—a synthesis embedding formal structure in an evolutionary framework. By explicitly noting how it differs from standard definitions, we help readers understand its novel epistemic status as a tool whose authority comes from proven track record, not logical or metaphysical properties.

### 3. Glossary Section: Refined definitions (lines 435-436)
**Location:** Part 2 of Glossary, "The Deflationary Path"

**Enhanced:** Both "Proposition" and "Standing Predicate" entries now include explicit comparisons to their usage in other disciplines.

**Rationale:** The glossary serves as a reference point for readers. By incorporating the comparative analysis from propositions_predicates.md, we make the glossary more pedagogically effective, helping readers from different backgrounds (CS, philosophy, general epistemology) understand how familiar terms are being adapted for this framework.

## Philosophy Behind Changes

These edits maintain the paper's existing commitments while adding precision through contrast. They don't introduce new concepts but clarify existing ones by explicitly acknowledging how the paper's technical vocabulary relates to established usage in adjacent fields. This addresses potential reviewer concerns about terminological innovation and demonstrates awareness of how the framework builds upon (and departs from) existing traditions.

The changes are minimal and surgical—adding 1-2 sentences at strategic points rather than rewriting sections—to avoid disrupting the paper's flow while significantly improving conceptual clarity.
