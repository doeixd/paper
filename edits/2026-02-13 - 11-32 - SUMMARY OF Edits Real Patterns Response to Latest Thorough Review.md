# Summary of Edits

## Scope

Implemented a focused revision pass on `real-patterns-as-closure.md` following the latest detailed review, with emphasis on admissibility constraints, non-Markov bridging, leakiness governance, and explicit criterion presentation.

## Major Changes

1. Added a compact admissibility triad in the introduction:
   - epistemic admissibility,
   - dynamical admissibility,
   - explanatory admissibility.
2. Added an explicit criterion statement near the roadmap to consolidate the paper's core test in one place.
3. Clarified objecthood in Section 2.2 as eligibility for stable macro-level counterfactual and interventional targeting, not fundamentality.
4. Added a brief proof sketch under the Markov lemma to make the exact-case derivation explicit.
5. Added a non-Markov bridge paragraph in Section 3.2: closure over enriched histories with strong lumpability as the first-order special case.
6. Added a short coding-trick counterexample paragraph in Section 3.4 to show why compression alone is insufficient.
7. Strengthened leakiness methodology in Section 5.2 with:
   - minimal proxy requirements,
   - note on expected diagnostic convergence/disagreement,
   - explicit failure-mode list (confounding, nonstationarity, partial observability, estimator bias).
8. Reinforced Section 7 with explicit ladder references (Level 2 pattern claims vs Level 4 representation claims) to avoid category slippage in examples.

## Rationale

- These edits address the highest-probability referee pressure points without expanding scope or changing thesis.
- The paper now presents a more explicit bridge from criterion to method to metaphysical payoff.
- Added structure improves scanability for reviewers evaluating formal clarity quickly.

## Style and Standards

- No em dashes introduced.
- No pseudo-quantification introduced.
- Mathematical notation remains in LaTeX delimiters.
