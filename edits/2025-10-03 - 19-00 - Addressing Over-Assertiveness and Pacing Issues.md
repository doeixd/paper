# Summary of Revisions Addressing Over-Assertiveness and Pacing

## Overview
Implemented feedback to mitigate risks of over-assertiveness in empirical claims and improve pacing/information density. Changes dial back certainty on specific numbers while consolidating content for better narrative flow.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Dialing Back Empirical Claims
- **Introduction (Miasma Theory)**: Changed "requiring over 50 ad-hoc modifications by 1850" to "historical analyses suggest the need for dozens of ad-hoc modifications by the mid-19th century". Removed potentially inappropriate Snow (1855) citation. This maintains illustrative power while avoiding vulnerable specificity.
- **AI Brittleness Score (Section 2.5)**: Changed "Composite brittleness scores for deep learning circa 2023 approach 0.6, comparable to Ptolemaic astronomy, suggesting vulnerability..." to "These trends suggest that, by the metrics of this framework, deep learning's brittleness score is rising, inviting comparison to the structural dynamics of past degenerating research programs like late-stage Ptolemaic astronomy." This frames the comparison as suggestive rather than definitive, reducing attack surface for specialists.

### 2. Improving Pacing and Structure
- **Merged Structural Realism Discussion**: Combined Section 6.5 content into the main Structural Realism paragraph in Section 6.3, creating a single, cohesive discussion. Removed the standalone subsection to eliminate flow disruption.
- **Consolidated Negative Canon Examples**: Simplified the list in Section 4.1 from detailed metrics ("M(t) escalated with 200+ modifications...") to a clean reference: "E.g., phlogiston chemistry, miasma theory, luminiferous aether, and blank slate psychology, as detailed in our worked examples." This reduces clutter while directing readers to the core empirical sections (2.5) for depth.

## Rationale and Impact
These changes address the tension between empirical grounding and reviewer vulnerability. By softening claims to "suggest" rather than "prove" equivalence, the paper maintains provocative insights without overreach. Structural consolidations improve readability by concentrating detailed examples in dedicated sections, preventing information overload in narrative passages. The result is a more robust manuscript that invites engagement rather than easy dismissal.

## Quality Standards Maintained
- **Falsifiability**: Claims remain testable but less dogmatic.
- **Narrative Flow**: Consolidated content reduces density without losing substance.
- **Defensive Writing**: Pre-empts specialist critiques by framing as methodology demonstrations.
- **Conciseness**: Removed redundant details while preserving core arguments.

Total changes: 4 targeted edits, focusing on precision and pacing.
