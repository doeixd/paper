## Revision Summary

This revision addresses the highest-impact reviewer concerns by prioritizing conceptual clarity, terminology discipline, and explicit argument structure in `final.md`.

### 1) Epistemology vs metaphysics separation made explicit

- Rewrote the core of Section 4.2 to state a strict two-level architecture:
  - epistemology: coherentist-externalist warrant at the network level,
  - metaphysics: structural realism about mind-independent constraints.
- Clarified that references to "alignment with causal structure" describe an external selection condition on networks, not a return to proposition-by-proposition correspondence testing.

Why: This directly addresses the coherentism-versus-correspondence objection while preserving the paper's intended hybrid position.

### 2) Multiple-peaks objection substantially strengthened

- Reframed the Apex as the maximally shared load-bearing structure across viable networks.
- Added the key point that if viable systems share any beliefs, an intersection exists by definition; the substantive issue is thickness, not existence.
- Added explicit concession: the convergent core can be thin in weakly constrained domains, without collapsing into relativism.
- Preserved pluralism at the frontier but tied it to bounded variation under shared constraints.

Why: This turns the previous defensive response into a direct answer in the paper's own terms and reduces vulnerability to the isolation objection.

### 3) Analytic terminology corrections

- Replaced "Justified Truth" with "Warranted Assertion" in the three-level framework and downstream references.
- Preserved the standard distinction: beliefs/assertions are justified, truth is not.
- Retained Level 1 objective truth as a regulative target and Level 3 contextual coherence as baseline internal status.

Why: This resolves the category-error reading that blocked uptake by analytic reviewers.

### 4) Jargon and structural cleanup

- Removed dependence on the glossary in body text and deleted Appendix B glossary.
- Replaced fragile phrasing in historical examples (e.g., removed numerical epicycle claim).
- Tightened introduction wording on "evidence vs viability" so viability includes but is not reducible to evidential success.

Why: This lowers cognitive load, reduces reviewer friction, and keeps the argument focused on mechanism rather than terminology overhead.

## Files Edited

- `final.md`

## Resilience Gains

- Stronger defense against the multiple-peaks/isolation objection.
- Cleaner statement of what is novel versus inherited from Quine/Lakatos traditions.
- Lower risk of rejection based on terminology misuse rather than substantive disagreement.
