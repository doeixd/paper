## What changed

- Added a direct quotation of Dennett's compressibility criterion in the introduction ("more efficient than the bit map") and clarified why compression alone is insufficient for macro-objecthood.
- Added a direct quotation of Dennett's lost-sock-center example in Section 4.2 and made the paper's stricter stance explicit: failed closure means no macro-object status for the regime.
- Added a direct quotation of Dennett's Martian/Laplacean-super-physicist passage in Section 9.1 to sharpen the instrumentalism objection and clarify the closure-based reply.

## Why these edits were made

The manuscript already diagnosed permissiveness and instrumentalist drift, but the case is stronger when the pressure points are textually anchored in Dennett's own formulations. These additions make the paper's "patch" structure clearer to reviewers: the criterion is presented as a response to specific commitments in *Real Patterns* rather than to a generic caricature.

## Scope and resilience checks

- Kept the edits small and local to existing argumentative nodes (Intro, 4.2, 9.1).
- Preserved the charitable framing from Section 8: tightening/explication rather than wholesale rejection.
- Avoided adding new terminology or expanding scope into historical exegesis.
- Maintained style constraints (no footnotes, no em dashes, concise prose).
