The changes focused on improving clarity, consistency in terminology, academic tone, and ensuring appropriate citations.

## Specific Changes

### 1. Abstract Refinements
- **Location**: Abstract paragraph.
- **Deletion**: "Coherentist theories of justification remain vulnerable... The framework introduces systemic fragility, a diagnostic measuring... I argue that..."
- **Replacement**: "Coherentist theories of justification are vulnerable... The framework introduces systemic brittleness, a diagnostic tool for measuring... We argue that..."
- **Rationale**: Updated to present tense for current relevance; ensured consistency by using "brittleness" instead of "fragility" (term used throughout the paper); added "tool" for clarity; changed "I" to "we" for academic humility and consistency.

### 2. Introduction Refinements
- **Location**: Introduction, paragraph on Systemic Externalism.
- **Deletion**: "The framework, which I term **Systemic Externalism**... low **fragility**..."
- **Replacement**: "The framework, which we term **Systemic Externalism**... low **brittleness**..."
- **Rationale**: Changed "I" to "we" for consistency and humility; replaced "fragility" with "brittleness" for terminological consistency.

### 3. Introduction Example Citation
- **Location**: Introduction, miasma theory example.
- **Deletion**: "Miasma theory's fragility can be illustrated... historical accounts of 19th-century medical debates..."
- **Replacement**: "Miasma theory's brittleness can be illustrated... Snow 1855..."
- **Rationale**: Consistency in terminology ("brittleness"); replaced vague "historical accounts" with specific citation (Snow 1855, already in references.md) for scholarly precision.
