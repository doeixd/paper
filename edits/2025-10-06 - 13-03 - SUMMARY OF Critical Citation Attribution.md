# Summary of Critical Citation Attribution (2025-10-06)

## Overview
This round addresses "Category 1: Direct and Important Missing Citations" - citations supporting empirical claims and theoretical comparisons that exist in final.md but lacked proper attribution. These are the most critical omissions where the argument is present but unattributed.

## Citations Integrated (2 new citations)

### 1. **Sevilla et al. (2022)** - AI Development Trends
- **Location**: Section 2.3, Case 2: Contemporary AI Development (line 76)
- **Context**: Empirical claim about exponential parameter escalation in deep learning
- **Integration**: Added "(Sevilla et al. 2022)" after "exponential escalation of parameter counts and computational resources for marginal performance gains"
- **Rationale**: This is the empirical backbone of the AI case study. Without this citation, the claim about compute trends was an unattributed assertion. Sevilla et al.'s arXiv preprint provides the quantitative data showing exponential compute growth across ML eras.
- **Bibliographic Entry**: Already in references.md
- **Importance**: HIGH - Direct empirical support for a contemporary case study

### 2. **Lugones (2003)** - Decolonial Epistemology
- **Location**: Section 6.2, Social Epistemology (line 512)
- **Context**: Discussion of standpoint theory and marginalized perspectives
- **Integration**: Added to citation alongside Harding (1991): "(Harding 1991; Lugones 2003)"
- **Rationale**: Strengthens engagement with decolonial epistemology. Lugones's work on coalition-building across oppressions provides specific theoretical grounding for how marginalized perspectives detect suppressed costs. The framework's discussion of "epistemic suppression" vs. "epistemic failure" resonates with Lugones's analysis.
- **Bibliographic Entry**: Already in references.md
- **Importance**: MEDIUM-HIGH - Strengthens feminist/decolonial scholarship engagement

## Citations Verified as Already Present

### **Zagzebski (1996)** - Virtue Epistemology
- **Status**: ALREADY CITED at line 502 in Section 6.1.2
- **Context**: "Systemic Externalism contrasts with Process Reliabilism (Goldman 1979) and Virtue Epistemology (Zagzebski 1996)."
- **Analysis**: User's list identified this as missing, but it's actually present in final.md. No action needed.

## Citations Verified as Appropriately Excluded

### **Goodman (1983)** - Reflective Equilibrium
- **Original Use**: In paper.md, framed "constrained interpretation" as "pragmatic reflective equilibrium"
- **Current Status in final.md**: The detailed methodological discussion using "reflective equilibrium" terminology was removed
- **Decision**: Correctly excluded. The argument no longer exists in final.md.

### **Christensen (2007) & Fricker (2007)** - Disagreement and Testimony
- **Original Use**: In paper.md, supported a detailed tiered model for bridging macro-micro gap via disagreement/testimony
- **Current Status in final.md**: This entire detailed discussion was condensed to a single paragraph citing only Kelly (2005)
- **Decision**: Correctly excluded. The detailed disagreement/testimony framework was intentionally condensed in final.md.

## Category Analysis

### Category 1: Direct and Important (Addressed)
✓ Sevilla et al. (2022) - ADDED
✓ Zagzebski (1996) - Already present
✓ Lugones (2003) - ADDED

### Category 2: From Condensed Sections (Appropriately Excluded)
✗ Goodman (1983) - Section removed
✗ Christensen (2007) - Section condensed
✗ Fricker (2007) - Section condensed

### Category 3: In references.md but Unused
These entries remain in references.md for potential future use or because they were used in earlier drafts. No action needed unless doing a comprehensive bibliography cleanup.

## Methodology Notes

### Verification Process
1. Searched final.md for each claimed missing citation
2. Confirmed Zagzebski (1996) was already present
3. Verified Goodman, Christensen, Fricker arguments were removed/condensed
4. Added only citations where arguments still exist but attribution was missing

### Conservative Approach
Maintained policy of not adding citations that would require content expansion. Only added citations supporting existing, unattributed claims.

## Total Citation Integration Summary (All Three Rounds)

### Round 1 (Initial Missing Citations)
- 13 citations integrated

### Round 2 (Additional Contextual Citations)
- 3 citations integrated

### Round 3 (Critical Attribution)
- 2 new citations integrated
- 1 verified as already present
- 3 verified as appropriately excluded

### Grand Total
- **18 new citations** properly attributed across final.md
- **3 bibliographic entries** added/corrected (Goldman 1999, Lehrer 1990, Pritchard 2016)
- **1 citation** (Zagzebski 1996) verified as already present
- **Multiple citations** appropriately excluded due to section removal/condensation

## Impact

The critical additions in this round address the most glaring gaps:
1. **Empirical grounding**: Sevilla et al. provides quantitative support for AI case study
2. **Intersectional scholarship**: Lugones strengthens engagement with decolonial epistemology

final.md now has robust scholarly attribution for all major empirical claims and theoretical comparisons while maintaining its deliberate concision.
