## What changed

- Added one forward-link sentence in Section 2.1 showing the ladder is used later in Sections 5.1, 5.4, and 10.
- Added an explicit bridge in Section 4.2: many permissive disjunctive constructions are entailed but unstable.
- Added an operational downgrade rule in Section 5.4: entailed-but-non-robust candidates are descriptive residue, not macro-objecthood, for the regime.
- Added one caution line in Section 9.4: formal coherence is suggestive but not ontologically decisive for empirical objecthood.
- Added a concise social-kind implementation illustration in Section 10 (structure and representation can persist while implementation failure removes causal efficacy).

## Why these edits were made

This pass addresses reviewer uptake and argumentative visibility. The manuscript already contained the relevant commitments, but some links were implicit. The revisions make those links explicit without increasing scope or introducing new terminology.

## Scope and style checks

- Targeted, local changes only.
- No change to core criterion or commitment structure.
- Preserved concise style and existing qualifications.
