# Summary of Edits: Refining "The Reality of Wholes"

## Date: 2025-12-17
## Objective
Refine the markdown file "The Reality of Wholes.md" to align with the stylistic preferences outlined in `CLAUDE.md` and improve overall clarity and flow.

## Changes Made

1.  **Removal of Em-dashes**: Replaced all em-dashes (—) with colons (:), semicolons (;), or commas per the strict prohibition in `CLAUDE.md`.
2.  **Tone Adjustment**:
    -   Reduced the use of contractions (e.g., "isn't" to "is not") to maintain a clearer, more measured academic tone.
    -   Smoothed transitions between paragraphs, particularly in Parts 1, 2, and 3.
    -   Ensured the "four givens" vs "five" listing in the introduction was syntactically clear.
3.  **Flow and Clarity**:
    -   Refined the introduction to clearer present the "four premises -> fifth consequence" argument.
    -   Clarified the distinction between "Scenario A" and "Scenario B" in Part 3 to flow better as narrative text.
    -   Improved the "tu quoque" argument in the introduction for punchiness.
    -   Tightened the explanation of the "Markov blanket" definition in Part 1.
4.  **Formatting**:
    -   Ensured consistent section headers.
    -   Verified that "conceptual illustrations" (like the 100 particles) are framed as such.

## Rationale
The primary goal was to ensure the paper meets the "Academic Philosophy Paper" standard: authoritative but humble, precise, and devoid of distracting punctuation like em-dashes which were explicitly flagged in the style guide.
