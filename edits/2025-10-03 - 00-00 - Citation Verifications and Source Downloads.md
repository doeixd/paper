# Summary of Edits: Citation Verifications and Source Downloads

## Changes Made
- No changes to references.md; all checked citations are accurate.

## Explanation
Verified citations for several books and articles via publisher websites. Details match the references. No DOIs found for books, as they are not typically assigned to books in the same way as articles. Citations follow Chicago style correctly.

## Source Downloads
- PDFs downloaded for open-access articles (Ayvazov 2025, Baggio & Parravicini 2019).
- For paywalled articles and books, no free PDFs available; abstracts or descriptions saved where possible.

## Rationale
Ensures the paper's references are reliable and verifiable. Downloads provide access to sources for review.
