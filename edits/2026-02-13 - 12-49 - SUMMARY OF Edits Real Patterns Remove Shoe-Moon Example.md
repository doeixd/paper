# Summary of Edits

## Scope

Removed the specific "Shoe-Moon" example from `real-patterns-as-closure.md` and replaced it with more general wording.

## Changes

1. Intro sentence now references arbitrary aggregates and disjunctive kinds, without naming Shoe-Moon.
2. Section 4.3 takeaway now refers to arbitrary disjunctive groupings.
3. Section heading `6.1` changed from `Shoe-Moon and disjunctive composites` to `Disjunctive composites`.

## Rationale

- Keeps the philosophical point while avoiding a niche example that may distract or confuse readers.
