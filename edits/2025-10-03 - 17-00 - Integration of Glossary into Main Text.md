## Summary of Changes

### Edits Implemented
1. **Abstract and Section 1 Core Framework Terms**: Integrated inline definitions for EPC, Systemic Externalism, and Realist Pragmatism upon first mention. This embeds key concepts seamlessly, preempting jargon confusion and providing logical context (e.g., EPC as synthesizing coherentism, pragmatism, and emergence).

2. **Section 2.2 Units of Analysis**: Replaced bullet-point lists for Shared Network and Standing Predicate with narrative explanations. Added integration of the Deflationary Path, weaving terms into the flow for better readability and cross-referencing.

3. **Sections 2.3 and 2.5 Dynamics Terms**: Condensed lists into functional examples and qualifications for pragmatic pushback, costs, and brittleness modalities. This reduces repetition, qualifies claims humbly (e.g., brittleness measured by costs), and guides readers through logical connections (e.g., pushback generates costs that signal misalignment).

4. **Section 4 Objectivity Terms**: Added regulative ideal framing for Negative Canon, Apex Network, and Consensus Network. Enhanced truth levels section implicitly through existing structure, ensuring fallibilist tone and mind-independent commitments.

### Rationale and Impact
- **Clarity and Flow**: Inline definitions follow academic best practices (e.g., from academia.stackexchange.com), avoiding separate glossaries that disrupt narrative. This maintains philosophical precision while enhancing accessibility.
- **Humility and Qualifications**: All additions include caveats (e.g., "fallible", "approximate"), preempting objections and aligning with the paper's balanced tone.
- **Logical Guidance**: Edits hold the reader's hand through assumptions (e.g., if networks emerge from pressure, then they drive convergence), strengthening argumentative coherence.
- **Defensiveness**: Addresses reviewer concerns proactively, such as relativism via Negative Canon's constraints and brittleness as measurable.
- **Conciseness**: Removed redundant lists without losing detail, improving readability for peer review.
- **Consistency**: Terms like brittleness are now defined contextually, reducing ambiguity.

These changes transform the paper from glossary-dependent to self-contained, preparing it for publication by embedding explanations where terms arise, as recommended in philosophy writing guides.
