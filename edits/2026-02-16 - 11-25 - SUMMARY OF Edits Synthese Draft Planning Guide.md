## Scope

Created a new guiding document for drafting a Synthese-targeted manuscript: `real-patterns-need-closure-SYNTHESE.md`.

## New File

- `real-patterns-need-closure-SYNTHESE-PLAN.md`

## What the Guide Contains

1. Clear purpose and thesis lock for the new version.
2. Scope boundaries that distinguish core argument from companion-paper material.
3. Voice and style commitments aligned with `STYLE_GUIDE.md`.
4. Section blueprint and required argumentative moves per section.
5. Non-negotiable content list and explicit exclusions.
6. Citation and positioning strategy for Synthese-facing dialogue.
7. Risk-preemption map for common reviewer objections.
8. Concrete drafting workflow and readiness checklist.

## Rationale

The current paper is strong but broad. The planning guide is designed to produce a tighter, publication-oriented version that preserves the core philosophical contribution while reducing overextension risk and improving reviewer legibility.
