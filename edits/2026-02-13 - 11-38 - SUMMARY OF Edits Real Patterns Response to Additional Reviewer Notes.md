# Summary of Edits

## Scope

Applied a focused revision pass to `real-patterns-as-closure.md` based on additional reviewer notes, with emphasis on intervention-class defense, regime dependence, technical clarity, and scope control.

## Major Revisions

1. Strengthened predictive/interventional distinction by stating explicitly that interventional closure is the ontological standard and predictive closure is the operational proxy.
2. Clarified the toy lumpability example by making the $\alpha \neq \gamma$ consequence explicit for $B_1 \to B_1/B_2$ prediction insufficiency.
3. Added explicit regime-dependent ontology language in Section 5.1, including a phase-transition style clarification that patterns can lose closure across regimes.
4. Added a plain-language note after pseudo-code in Section 5.3 clarifying it is a procedural recipe, not a programming requirement.
5. Tightened Section 9.4 scope control by restricting the argument to spatiotemporal, world-implemented patterns and treating formal systems as a contrast class.
6. Added one explicit sentence in related-work positioning distinguishing Rosas et al.'s formal contribution from this paper's philosophical criterion-setting contribution.

## Rationale

- These edits directly reduce likely reviewer objections around residual instrumentalism, accessibility, and domain slippage.
- The manuscript now more explicitly owns regime dependence as a substantive strength, not an embarrassment.

## Style and Standards

- No em dashes introduced.
- No pseudo-quantification introduced.
- Mathematical notation preserved in LaTeX delimiters.
