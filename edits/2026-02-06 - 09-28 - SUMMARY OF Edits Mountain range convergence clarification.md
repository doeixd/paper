## Revision Summary

This edit strengthens the paper's response to the local-peaks objection by formalizing the mountain-range framing and tying it to explicit methodological consequences.

### What changed

1. **Section 4.4.2 reframed with mountain-range geometry**
   - Added explicit statement that viable theories can occupy different peaks on a shared mountain range.
   - Clarified that the Apex Network denotes the shared load-bearing base and ridge structure, not any single peak.
   - Preserved qualification that overlap thickness varies by domain strength of constraints.

2. **Equal-cost rival peaks now handled explicitly**
   - Added a rule for frontier ties: when rival systems show comparable brittleness over tested ranges, the framework assigns provisional Level 2 warrant parity.
   - Clarified that this is not truth symmetry by stipulation. It is temporary underdetermination.
   - Added methodological consequence: discriminate at the edges by generating new tests where the rivals diverge.

3. **Section 7.2 now includes a direct, falsifiable overlap prediction**
   - Added a second prediction: independently developed viable systems should show substantial structural overlap that tends to increase as edge cases are tested.
   - Added explicit falsifier condition: if viable systems remain mostly disjoint over time (archipelago pattern), the Apex claim must be weakened.
   - Extended methodology with a third step to track overlap trajectories across independent traditions.

4. **Frontier example sharpened**
   - Tightened the quantum interpretations example to show that deep disagreement can persist at the frontier while a shared predictive core remains stable.

### Why this improves reviewer resilience

- Converts the multiple-peaks section from a defensive denial into a positive geometric model with testable implications.
- Prevents overclaiming by admitting genuine temporary parity when costs are comparable.
- Shows that experiments are not auxiliary rhetoric but the formal mechanism for resolving frontier underdetermination.
- Raises the framework's empirical accountability by stating a clear failure condition.
