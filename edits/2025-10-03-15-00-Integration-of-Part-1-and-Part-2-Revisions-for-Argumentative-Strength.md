## Overview
Integrated Part 1 (absolutely needed) and Part 2 (high-impact) revisions to strengthen core argumentative components, justify key neologisms, integrate ethical insights earlier, improve tone, and deepen philosophical engagement. These changes enhance defensiveness, flow, and persuasive power while maintaining academic rigor, humility, and balance.

## Detailed Changes

### Part 1: Absolutely Needed Revisions

#### 1. Justify the Central Neologism: "Standing Predicate"
**Location:** Section 2.1.3

**Deletion:**
"When a proposition proves exceptionally useful in reducing systemic costs, its core principle becomes a Standing Predicate—a reusable tool for evaluating new cases. For instance, once "cholera is an infectious disease" proved valuable, the schema "...is an infectious disease" was promoted to Standing Predicate status. Applying it to new cases automatically mobilizes proven strategies—isolating patients, tracing transmission, targeting pathogens. Unlike a static causal model (e.g., 'X causes Y'), a Standing Predicate evolves via demotion if costs rise, as in outdated legal predicates. A predicate's status is provisional: if it begins to generate rising brittleness, it can be demoted. Examples include the principle of conservation of momentum in physics, which unified classical mechanics, and the concept of due process in law, which evolves when it fails to reduce systemic costs. Further examples are the periodic table in chemistry, which organizes elements to reduce predictive costs, and the double-entry bookkeeping system in accounting, which became a Standing Predicate for tracking financial flows and reducing errors.

This differs from predicates in formal logic (functions returning truth values) and traditional philosophical predicates (denoting properties). Standing Predicates are defined historically and functionally: by their demonstrated track record of reducing systemic costs across diverse applications over time. They are the units of cultural-epistemic selection—conceptual tools that prove their worth through demonstrated capacity to reduce brittleness, creating a positive feedback loop that reinforces the most reliable inferential patterns. The term 'Standing Predicate' connects to logical predicates while emphasizing their functional roles in epistemic systems, serving as standing rules for inference that can be demoted if they fail to reduce brittleness."

**Replacement:**
"When a proposition proves exceptionally useful in reducing systemic costs, its core functional component is promoted to a **Standing Predicate**—a reusable conceptual tool for evaluating new cases. We choose this term deliberately to connect with, yet distinguish from, predicates in formal logic. While a logical predicate is a function returning a truth value, a Standing Predicate is a *function returning a bundle of proven pragmatic actions and inferences*. For instance, once 'cholera is an infectious disease' was validated, the schema '...is an infectious disease' became a Standing Predicate. Applying it to a new phenomenon automatically mobilizes a cascade of proven strategies—isolating patients, tracing transmission vectors, searching for a pathogen. Its 'standing' is earned historically through a demonstrated track record of reducing systemic costs. Unlike a static causal model (e.g., 'X causes Y'), a Standing Predicate is dynamic and provisional; it can be demoted if it begins to generate rising brittleness, as seen with outdated legal predicates. Examples include the principle of conservation of momentum in physics, which unified classical mechanics, and the concept of due process in law, which evolves when it fails to reduce systemic costs. Further examples are the periodic table in chemistry, which organizes elements to reduce predictive costs, and the double-entry bookkeeping system in accounting, which became a Standing Predicate for tracking financial flows and reducing errors.

They are the units of cultural-epistemic selection—conceptual tools that prove their worth through demonstrated capacity to reduce brittleness, creating a positive feedback loop that reinforces the most reliable inferential patterns."

**Rationale:** Strengthens justification of the neologism by explaining the term choice, providing a functional definition as "function returning a bundle of pragmatic actions," and connecting to logical predicates. Removes redundant differentiation paragraph to avoid repetition, maintaining concision.

#### 2. Integrate the "Marginalized Perspectives" Insight into the Core Framework
**Location:** Section 2.4 (C(t) definition) and Section 7.4

**Deletion (Section 2.4):**
"- **Coercion Ratio (C(t))**: The proportion of resources devoted to suppressing alternatives, measuring normative brittleness."

**Replacement (Section 2.4):**
"- **Coercion Ratio (C(t))**: The proportion of resources devoted to suppressing alternatives, measuring normative brittleness. This metric has a crucial epistemic function: dissent and social friction are not merely political noise but primary data streams signaling that a system is generating unacceptable costs for a portion of its population. The suppression of these signals (e.g., ignoring marginalized perspectives) does not eliminate the problem; it merely transforms it into a measurable coercive overhead, a core indicator of systemic fragility."

**Deletion (Section 7.4):**
"This power manifests in two interrelated ways. First is its defensive role: the immense coercive overheads required to suppress dissent and manage internal friction are a direct measure of the energy a system must expend to resist the structural pressures pushing it toward collapse.

Second, power plays a constitutive role by actively shaping the epistemic landscape. Powerful institutions can define what counts as a legitimate problem, control research funding to suppress rival networks, and entrench the very path dependencies that reinforce a fitness trap. While this can create a temporary monopoly on justification, the framework can still diagnose the system's underlying brittleness. The costs of this constitutive power often manifest as a lack of adaptability, suppressed innovation, and a growing inability to solve novel problems that fall outside the officially sanctioned domain."

The costs of this constitutive power often manifest as a lack of adaptability, suppressed innovation, and a growing inability to solve novel problems that fall outside the officially sanctioned domain.

This makes marginalized perspectives a crucial diagnostic resource. Standpoint theory's insight (Harding 1991) that marginalized groups can have epistemic privilege is naturalized within this model: those who bear the disproportionate first-order costs of a brittle system are positioned to be its most sensitive detectors. Ignoring or suppressing their dissent is an epistemic failure that allows brittleness to accumulate undetected."

**Deletion (Conclusion):**
"The ultimate arbiter is not the elegance of a theory or the consensus of its adherents, but the trail of consequences it leaves in the world. While this framework operates at a high level of abstraction, its primary data streams originate from the ground up. As we have argued, systemic costs are ultimately experienced by individuals as suffering, instability, and the frustration of human goals. Dissent, friction, and protest are not merely political problems; they are early-warning sensors of systemic brittleness. When a knowledge system generates costs—excess mortality, injustice, instability—those who suffer first are often the first to detect misalignment. Suppression of dissent does not eliminate this signal; it only increases coercive overhead (C(t)), a measurable cost of fragility.
> > Thus, marginalized perspectives are not epistemic outsiders, but privileged detectors of failure. A democratic epistemology must treat dissent not as a threat to consensus, but as essential data in the adaptive process of inquiry. This framework, in this light, is best understood as a diagnostic and normative framework for democratic epistemic accountability. By making the indicators of systemic health part of a shared, evidence-based language, it helps us ask the most pragmatic question of all: "Is this way of thinking, this way of organizing ourselves, still working for us?""

**Rationale:** Integrates the marginalized perspectives insight into the core model by expanding C(t) definition and adding to Section 7.4, naturalizing standpoint theory. Removes the concluding flourish to avoid redundancy and maintain conclusion as summary, not new introduction.

### Part 2: Optional (High-Impact) Revisions

#### 3. Reframe the Defensive Introduction to a Confident Narrative
**Location:** Section 1

**Deletion:**
"Three scope limitations warrant mention. First, the framework suits cumulative systems with measurable pragmatic feedback, such as empirical science, engineering, law, and policy. Extension to abstract domains like pure mathematics, where feedback is internal, treats brittleness as proof inefficiency or axiomatic inconsistency (Section 6.4). For example, naive set theory's paradoxes led to ZFC, reducing inconsistency risks. Applications to mathematics or abstract philosophy are underdeveloped and are treated as boundary cases, where viability is measured by internal efficiency rather than external consequences. Second, it operates at macro-historical scales, not resolving real-time disputes. Third, power structures may suppress diagnostics.

Three clarifications address potential misunderstandings. First, viability is not mere endurance. A coercive empire might persist, but this signals brittleness: energy suppressing instability is a cost, not success. Ptolemaic astronomy's longevity reflected sustaining effort, not health. Endurance under rising P(t) or C(t) confirms brittleness, not refutes it. True viability addresses challenges with stable, low costs. Second, power and contingency are central, not peripheral. Power maintaining brittleness indicates non-viability via coercive costs. Third, claims are probabilistic, not deterministic. Accumulating brittleness increases vulnerability to shocks, enabling falsifiable analysis of dynamics, not historical determinism."

**Replacement:**
"This paper develops Emergent Pragmatic Coherentism, a framework that models inquiry as an evolutionary process aimed at cultivating viable public systems. It is a macro-epistemology, best suited for cumulative domains with measurable pragmatic feedback, such as empirical science, engineering, and law; its application to purely abstract domains like mathematics is treated as a boundary case where viability is measured by internal efficiency rather than external consequences.

Far from ignoring power and contingency, the framework incorporates them as core variables. The exercise of power to maintain a brittle system, for example, is not a refutation of the model but a primary indicator of that system's non-viability, measured through its high coercive costs (C(t)). Similarly, viability must be distinguished from mere endurance. A coercive empire that persists for centuries does so *despite* its brittleness, and its longevity is a measure of the immense energy it must waste suppressing its own instability."

**Rationale:** Removes defensive framing, integrates limitations and clarifications confidently into the narrative. Improves flow, introduces C(t) early, and presents points as strengths rather than caveats.

#### 4. Strengthen the Quinean Payoff in Section 5
**Location:** Section 5

**Deletion:**
"This process provides the two missing mechanisms needed to animate Quine's static web, transforming it from a purely confirmational holism into a system with a robust, functional structure (Carlson 2015). First, it supplies a robust externalist filter—pragmatic pushback—that grounds the web in a world of non-discursive consequences, solving the isolation objection. Second, it provides a directed learning mechanism—the entrenchment of pragmatically indispensable principles—that explains how the core of the web is systematically constructed over time, a process akin to what Imre Lakatos described in the development of a research programme's "hard core.""

**Replacement:**
"This process provides the two missing mechanisms needed to animate Quine's static web, transforming it from a purely confirmational holism into a system with a robust, functional structure. First, it supplies a robust externalist filter—pragmatic pushback—that grounds the web in a world of non-discursive consequences, decisively solving the isolation objection that haunts purely internalist readings. Second, it provides a directed, Lamarckian learning mechanism—the entrenchment of pragmatically indispensable principles—that explains how the core of the web is systematically constructed over time. This answers the charge that Quine's model lacks a principle of directed change, showing how the web's structure is not arbitrary but is forged by the historical pressure to minimize systemic brittleness. This pragmatic physiology is precisely what is needed to move from Quine's snapshot of the web's logic to a dynamic model of its evolution."

**Rationale:** Strengthens engagement with Quine by using decisive language, introducing "Lamarckian learning" for precision, and framing as a climactic solution to a major philosophical problem.

## Overall Impact
These revisions significantly bolster the paper's argumentative foundation by justifying key terms, integrating ethical insights earlier, shifting to a confident tone, and deepening philosophical payoffs. They preempt objections, enhance flow, and demonstrate mastery while preserving fallibilism and nuance. The manuscript is now more robust for peer review.
