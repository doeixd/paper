# 2026-02-16 - 08:16 - Summary of Six Structural Revisions to Closure Paper

## Overview
Implemented six revisions to `real-patterns-as-closure.md` based on external review suggestions, filtered through project preferences and voice.

## Changes Made

### 1. New Section 7.4: Social Kinds Under the Protocol
Promoted the social-kinds material from the conclusion into a full worked-example section alongside hurricanes, cells, and borderline cases. Three cases developed:
- **Money:** transactional structure as macro-state, heterogeneous micro-realizations (coins, digital, ledgers), low leakiness under monetary policy interventions.
- **Corporations:** governance structure as macro-state, closure holds when implementation infrastructure (courts, records, enforcement) functions.
- **Failed states:** the structure-implementation-representation distinction does its sharpest work here. Closure fails when implementation collapses even if structure and representation persist. This is the criterion doing something distinctive: explaining when a social entity stops being a real macro-object without requiring it was never real or that belief sustains it.

The conclusion's social-kinds paragraphs were trimmed to a brief pointer to Section 7.4.

**Rationale:** The criterion's ability to handle social kinds without modification is a major selling point. Burying it in "future work" understated the framework's reach.

### 2. Non-Markov Treatment Moved into Section 3.2
Expanded the brief non-Markov mention in Section 3.2 into a proper treatment: the criterion is closure of macro-transition structure, nothing requires first-order Markov, enriched state $H_t$ is what the state is when the system has memory (immune systems, path-dependent economies), strong lumpability over $H_t$ is the same test. Section 9.3 shortened to a brief pointer back to Section 3.2.

**Rationale:** Having the non-Markov case appear only in objections made it read as a concession under pressure. It is a straightforward consequence of the criterion and belongs in the main development.

### 3. Structural Realism Paragraph Added to Section 9.1
Added the strongest anti-instrumentalism move: on structural realist metaphysics, there is no intelligible gap between "tracks causal structure" and "is real." The prediction shortfall is the structural fact, not a proxy for something deeper. The charge of instrumentalism only lands if one assumes intrinsic stuff behind causal structure, which structural realism denies.

**Rationale:** This was the paper's most powerful anti-instrumentalism argument and it was missing entirely.

### 4. Section 2.1 Lightly Tightened
Merged the "Level 5 auditability" note into the main paragraph flow and consolidated the type-token and implementation-representation paragraphs. All substantive content preserved, including the numbered ladder with examples.

**Rationale:** Faster pacing to the criterion without losing any defenses or explanatory detail.

### 5. Section 1.1 Value-Add Sharpened
Merged the two "Rosas et al." paragraphs into one that clearly separates the formal machinery (Rosas et al.) from the philosophical contribution (this paper): explicit exclusion conditions, graded assessment, application to macro-objecthood rather than mere modeling.

**Rationale:** A referee will ask what this does that Rosas et al. don't. The answer is now pointed and immediate.

### 6. Section 8.4 Composition Expanded
Added the temporality and regime-dependence point: composition is temporary because parts compose a whole when and where closure holds. Same components can compose a functioning entity in one regime and fail to in another. Van Inwagen's question gets a dynamic answer.

**Rationale:** Completes the philosophical payoff of the composition point without adding new apparatus.

## What Was Not Changed
Tone, formal content, toy example, hurricane and cell cases, phlogiston illustration, overall architecture. These are working. The revisions add material that was already implied, make the strongest philosophical moves explicit, and don't introduce any new apparatus. The criterion stays the same.
