## Scope

Started the new Synthese-oriented manuscript as requested: `real-patterns-need-closure-SYNTHESE.md`.

## What Was Drafted

Created a clean first-pass manuscript with the planned core structure:

1. Abstract with one problem, one thesis, and one novelty claim.
2. Introduction defining the permissiveness problem and core criterion.
3. Criterion section with closure definition, admissibility hierarchy, and prior-sensitivity framing.
4. Exact benchmark section using strong lumpability and computational-mechanics bridge language.
5. Approximate closure section with leakiness, procedural safeguards, and regime/projectibility clarification.
6. Focused objections section (instrumentalism, admissibility circularity, causal exclusion, Markov scope, abstract-object scope).
7. Bounded conclusion emphasizing criterion plus audit protocol.
8. Selected references section with key interlocutors.

## Why This Start

The draft prioritizes scope control and dialectical clarity for Synthese fit. It keeps philosophy primary, formalism supportive, and avoids broad side-program expansion in the initial pass.

## Next Drafting Priorities

1. Tighten novelty phrasing against specific interlocutors in the introduction.
2. Expand one objection-reply pair at a time while monitoring section word budgets.
3. Decide which examples remain in main text versus appendical support.
