## Scope

Integrated high-value points from an external critique into `real-patterns-need-closure-SYNTHESE.md` while preserving the paper's philosophical scope and voice.

## Critique Review Outcome

1. **Admissibility circularity concern**: Valid and worth fixing.
2. **Enriched-state dilemma**: Valid edge case requiring explicit concession.
3. **Best-of-bad-bunch problem**: Valid and needed explicit floor language.
4. **Section-number artifact claim**: Not applicable to current Synthese draft (no Section 7 references found).

## Manuscript Revisions

1. Refined explanatory admissibility in Section 2.4.
   - Replaced "stable invariances" phrasing with upstream, non-circular language focused on cross-context generalizability and non-trivial counterfactual reach.
   - Added explicit sentence that explanatory admissibility is set before closure verdicts and does not presuppose which partition will be stable.

2. Added minimum-viability safeguards in Section 4.
   - In 4.2, clarified that comparative ranking is necessary but not sufficient.
   - In 4.3, added a minimum-viability floor step: when all candidates remain high-leak and fragile, no robust objecthood verdict is returned.
   - In 4.6, added a matching failure condition for candidate sets that stay above the floor.

3. Strengthened non-Markov enrichment section (5.6).
   - Added explicit concession: if the minimally sufficient enriched state approaches micro-level complexity, closure may be recoverable without meaningful compression.
   - Clarified implication: this does not support robust macro-objecthood at that grain; it indicates no informative macro-partition has been found there.

4. Verified structural consistency.
   - Checked for stray references to non-existent Section 7/7.4 in current Synthese draft; none found.

## Rationale

These edits reduce three substantive reviewer vulnerabilities without inflating scope: circular admissibility language, comparative-only ranking risk, and compression-collapse edge cases in enriched-state responses.
