# Summary of Edits

## Scope

Integrated selected conceptual refinements from reviewer suggestions into `real-patterns-as-closure.md` to improve boundary clarity, readability, and defense against common category objections.

## Major Revisions

1. Added explicit implementation-versus-representation distinction to Section 2.1, clarifying that a process may be implemented even when current representations are partial or flawed.
2. Added stipulated-versus-induced closure distinction in Section 2.2 and used it to sharpen scope control:
   - stipulated closure: autonomy fixed by constitutive rules,
   - induced closure: autonomy discovered in world dynamics,
   - paper restricted to induced closure.
3. Revised Section 3.1 definition language to foreground the intuitive phrase "autonomy of what follows" and make the closure intuition more accessible before technical formalization.
4. Strengthened Section 9.1 with a social-kinds implementation clarification: legal stipulation has causal force only through physical enforcement mechanisms.
5. Updated Section 9.4 to align scope language with the stipulated/induced distinction rather than a generic contrast-class statement.

## Rationale

- These edits improve conceptual hygiene at exactly the points where reviewers typically press for category clarity.
- The paper now makes its domain boundary principled rather than merely strategic.
- The new phrasing improves readability for non-technical philosophers while preserving formal precision.

## Style and Standards

- No em dashes introduced.
- No pseudo-quantification introduced.
- Mathematical notation remains in LaTeX delimiters.
