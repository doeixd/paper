## Revision Summary

This pass makes targeted, argument-level improvements in `final.md` and `proc_v7.md` to integrate the recent clarification about goal-dependent normativity, structural realism, and fallibilist practical guidance.

### 1) `proc_v7.md`: clarify how goal-dependence avoids arbitrariness

- Added an explicit framing in the introduction: ought-claims are goal-indexed, but the relevant goals are anchored in built-in features of human social life (embodied vulnerability, cooperation dependence, finite cognition).
- This keeps the view conditional while avoiding the impression that goals are optional preferences selected ad hoc.

### 2) `proc_v7.md`: sharpen local vs global rightness

- In Section 4.4, added a concise distinction:
  - local rightness tracks what is justified within a current consensus network,
  - global rightness tracks alignment with the full constraint structure (Apex ideal).
- Added explicit fallibilist qualification: we approximate global rightness through historical learning and comparative testing.

### 3) `proc_v7.md`: strengthen circularity and naturalistic-fallacy replies

- In Section 5.4, added an "Embedded-Goal Clarification" to show why conditional normativity still has practical force.
- In Section 5.5, tightened the naturalistic-fallacy reply:
  - retained semantic externalist strategy,
  - added that the framework infers guidance for agents with our goal-structure under our constraints, rather than deriving unconditional moral law from bare facts.

### 4) `final.md`: align epistemic normativity language with same structure

- In Section 6.3.1, clarified that hypothetical imperatives are constrained by inquiry's constitutive aims (memory, transmission, coordination, error correction), not optional preferences.
- This harmonizes epistemic and normative treatments across the two papers without importing full metaethical machinery into `final.md`.

## Why this improves resilience

- Reduces vulnerability to "arbitrary goals" and "smuggled normativity" objections.
- Preserves strong objectivity claims while maintaining explicit fallibilism and humility.
- Keeps scope discipline: substantial metaethical development remains in `proc_v7.md`, while `final.md` receives only the minimal clarifying bridge.
