# Summary: Novelty Firewall and Special Sciences Objection

**Date:** 2026-02-16
**File:** `real-patterns-need-closure-SYNTHESE.md`

## Motivation

External review identified the biggest rejection risk: "This is basically lumpability/causal closure, and the Dennett connection is optional." Two specific gaps: (1) the novelty firewall in §3.4 was too thin to survive that charge, and (2) a predictable "closure is too strong and eliminates most special sciences" objection was missing entirely.

## Changes Made

### 1. Expanded §3.4 into "What the Formal Machinery Alone Does Not Provide"

Replaced the 3-paragraph causal-state equivalence discussion with a structured novelty argument naming four things the formal literature alone does not supply:

1. **Intervention indexing**: Causal-state constructions are observational-predictive. This criterion adds admissible interventions as a parameter.
2. **Explicit ontological interpretation**: Lumpability tells you when transitions are preserved. It does not tell you when to make realist commitments. That's philosophical work.
3. **Graded commitment protocol**: The formal literature offers exact conditions and approximate measures, not a framework for translating measures into warranted verdicts with robustness requirements and downgrade rules.
4. **Anti-gerrymandering argument**: The Dennett permissiveness problem is a philosophical problem. Lumpability provides a tool; the argument that closure is the right anti-gerrymandering condition is a philosophical claim, not a theorem.

Also added a clean causal-emergence contrast: EI gains are a valuable diagnostic but don't settle which macro-descriptions deserve realist commitment, since a partition can increase effective information while remaining fragile under intervention or horizon variation.

### 2. Added §5.6 "Closure Is Too Strong and Eliminates Most Special Sciences"

New objection and reply addressing the concern that closure eliminates biological species, psychological states, economic categories, etc. The reply turns on the graded verdict structure: most special-science kinds fall into qualified objecthood (partial closure with explicit regime limitations), which is the correct result. A criterion that granted robust objecthood regardless of leakiness would be the permissive framework the paper replaces. The gain is matching evidential reality rather than forcing binary realism/eliminativism.

### 3. Renumbered §5.6-5.9

Existing objections renumbered to accommodate the insertion.

## Rationale

These two additions address the reviewer's two highest-impact concerns:
- The novelty firewall directly answers "why not just use lumpability?"
- The special-sciences objection pre-empts the most predictable scope worry

Both additions stay within the paper's existing commitments and scope. No new framework machinery introduced.
