# Justfile Header Documentation

## Summary of Changes
- Added a comprehensive comment block to the top of justfile explaining how the automation layer relates to the scripts directory, how to invoke recipes, and the philosophy behind using Just as the single entry point.

## Rationale
- Keeping usage notes alongside the recipes prevents knowledge drift and gives future contributors an immediate orientation without reopening CLAUDE.md.
