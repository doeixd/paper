# Summary of Edits

## Scope

Applied a final micro-polish pass to `real-patterns-as-closure.md` based on reviewer flow and style suggestions.

## Changes

1. Updated abstract phrasing from "This paper then extends" to "The criterion is then extended" for smoother formal tone.
2. Removed an interruptive stance-paragraph from Section 3.2 to improve formal flow.
3. Relocated that stance clarification into Section 1.1 (Related work), where it now functions as field-positioning rather than a disruption in technical exposition.
4. Left the strong Section 9.1 sentence unchanged, as requested.

## Rationale

- Improves local readability without changing substantive claims.
- Makes Section 3.2 cleaner and more linear for readers following the formal thread.
