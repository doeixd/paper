## Scope

Follow-up pass after direct comparison between `real-patterns-as-closure.md` and `real-patterns-need-closure-SYNTHESE.md`.

## What Was Integrated

1. Added level-clarification scaffold to the Synthese draft.
   - New Section 2.11 introduces a concise distinction between world dynamics, pattern type, pattern token, and representation.
   - Purpose: prevent level-slippage objections without importing the full length of the original ladder section.

2. Added criterion culmination block before benchmark section.
   - New Section 2.12 summarizes criterion, graded extension, and commitment rule in a compact three-line structure.
   - Purpose: improve argumentative baton-pass into the formal benchmark and reduce repetition later.

3. Added a compact appendix with procedural transparency.
   - New Appendix A includes minimal decision schema, core diagnostic set, and failure triggers.
   - Purpose: recover the strongest procedural discipline from the original draft while keeping the main text philosophy-first.

## Rationale

These additions preserve Synthese scope discipline but recover high-value strengths from the original paper: conceptual scaffolding, criterion consolidation, and transparent application discipline.
