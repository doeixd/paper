# Summary of Edits

## Scope

Revised the abstract in `real-patterns-as-closure.md` to remove citations and improve clarity, flow, and reader accessibility while preserving argumentative depth.

## Changes

1. Removed parenthetical citations from the abstract to match journal-standard abstract style.
2. Rewrote the abstract into a tighter logical sequence:
   - problem,
   - criterion,
   - exact and approximate forms,
   - ontological versus evidential hierarchy,
   - exclusion and allowance conditions,
   - final contribution statement.
3. Integrated the prior stand-alone "Commitment structure" sentence directly into the abstract narrative for smoother reading.

## Rationale

- Improves first-pass comprehension and abstract-level persuasiveness.
- Keeps the abstract self-contained, concise, and aligned with submission norms.
