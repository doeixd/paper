# Summary of Edits: Final Publication Polish of proc_v7.md

## Date and Time
2025-10-07 - 16-30

## Overview
Performed final polish on proc_v7.md for publication readiness. Removed unnecessary boldface from headings, lists, and objection titles to improve readability and consistency. Ensured formatting is clean, writing is formal and error-free, citations are in Chicago style, and the document meets academic standards. No substantive content changes; only stylistic refinements.

## Specific Changes

### 1. Removed Bold from References Title
**Location:** End of document.

**Original Text:**
```
## **References**
```

**Modified Text:**
```
## References
```

**Rationale:** Standardized heading format without unnecessary bold, aligning with other section headers.

### 2. Removed Bold from Tier List Items in Section 2.2
**Location:** Section 2.2 (Tiered Diagnostic Framework).

**Original Text:**
```
*   **Tier 1: Bio-Social Costs** - Direct material consequences of friction with human persistence conditions, measured by objective proxies like excess mortality/morbidity rates, chronic malnutrition, and demographic decline. Systems generating these costs fail fundamentally.

*   **Tier 2: Systemic Friction Costs** - Resources expended managing dissent from Tier 1 costs, measured by the Coercion Ratio (C(t))—resources spent on suppression versus production—and information suppression costs like censorship. Rising C(t) indicates high maintenance costs for flawed designs.

*   **Tier 3: Ideological Costs** - Informational expenses justifying Tier 1 and 2 costs, measured by Patch Velocity (P(t))—rate of ad-hoc ideological justifications (e.g., divine mandates for suffering). High P(t) signals accumulating ideological debt in failing systems.
```

**Modified Text:**

```

**Rationale:** Removed bold from "Tier X" labels to reduce visual clutter. These are not key terms requiring emphasis; the content remains clear.

### 3. Removed Bold from Sentence in Section 1.2
**Location:** Section 1.2 (Thesis).

**Original Text:**
```
At its heart, this project is based on a simple idea: **moral principles are like engineering designs for social worlds.** Like any design, they can be elegant in theory but flawed in practice. When a bridge design is flawed, it generates stress, cracks, and eventually collapses. When a normative design is flawed—such as one built on slavery—it generates social stress (dissent, rebellion), structural cracks (coercive costs, economic stagnation), and is likewise prone to collapse. Our project is to develop the diagnostic tools to detect these structural flaws in our normative architectures *before* they lead to catastrophic failure.

**Rationale:** Removed bold from the core sentence to avoid over-emphasis. Italics on "before" retained for stress.

### 4. Removed Bold from List Items in Section 4.3
**Location:** Section 4.3 (The Structure of the Viable Normative Landscape).

**Original Text:**
```
- **Negative Canon (Floor)**: Most secure objective knowledge—what is demonstrably unworkable. Provides boundaries preventing relativism, mapped from historical failures like a "reef chart."
- **Convergent Core**: Principles (e.g., reciprocity) independently discovered across cultures, suggesting stable, low-cost coordination solutions.
- **Pluralist Frontier**: Domain of multiple viable solutions (e.g., different organizational models). Accommodates cultural diversity and disagreement as empirical questions about boundaries.
```

```

**Rationale:** Removed bold from key terms to maintain consistency and reduce emphasis overload. Terms like Negative Canon are defined in the glossary.

### 5. Removed Bold from Key Terms in Section 4.1.1
**Location:** Section 4.1.1 (The Pragmatic Procedure).

**Original Text:**
```
4. **Mapping the Landscape:** Through comparative analysis, we identify principles that reliably generate high costs and enter them into the **Negative Canon** (mapping the 'floor'). We also identify principles that repeatedly emerge in low-brittleness systems and add them to the **Convergent Core**.

```

**Rationale:** Removed bold from Negative Canon and Convergent Core for consistency, as they are not emphasized elsewhere in the same way.

### 6. Removed Bold from Objection Headers in Section 5.5
**Location:** Section 5.5 (Additional Objections and Replies).

**Original Text:**
```
**Objection: Cultural Relativism** - Different cultures have viable but incompatible norms. Reply: Compatible with pluralism in periphery while maintaining floor constraints. Cultural diversity exists within viability boundaries.

**Objection: Moral Progress Skepticism** - Progress claims are Western bias. Reply: Framework predicts pluralist periphery but universal floor. Progress diagnosed empirically via SBI reduction, not cultural superiority.

**Objection: Scientific Imperialism** - Reducing ethics to science (cf. Putnam 2002). Reply: Not scientism but unified pragmatic filter. Moral claims remain normative but justified externally like scientific ones.

**Objection: Evolutionary Debunking** - Evolutionary pressures shaped moral intuitions for survival, not truth (cf. Street 2006). Reply: EPC resolves Street's dilemma by collapsing one of its horns. The dilemma assumes that truth and adaptiveness are independent aims, making their alignment a coincidence. Our framework denies this premise. For us, moral truth *is* a specific, demanding form of long-term systemic adaptiveness (i.e., viability). Evolution is not a distorting influence that the realist must explain away; it is the broader category of filtering processes within which the specific, cost-based discovery of moral truth takes place. Pragmatic viability is what moral truth supervenes on.

**Objection: The Naturalistic Fallacy.** The framework seems to define 'the good' as 'the viable,' improperly deriving a value from a fact. Reply: This misinterprets the project. We are not deriving 'ought' from 'is' in the classic sense. Rather, we are offering a naturalistic reconstruction of the function of our normative practice. The claim is that what our successful moral discourse has actually been tracking all along are these facts about systemic viability. 'Wrongness' is not being defined as high-brittleness; rather, high-brittleness is the underlying natural property that the term 'wrongness' has been imperfectly latching onto. This naturalizes the reference of our moral terms, explaining their functional authority without committing a fallacy.

**Objection: How does this differ from Kitcher's 'Ethical Project'?** Reply: Our project shares much with Kitcher's (2011) view of ethics as a social technology for solving problems of altruism. However, EPC offers two crucial advancements. First, it provides a more general diagnostic toolkit (the SBI) that applies equally to scientific and ethical 'technologies,' grounding the project in a unified theory of justification. Second, EPC's concept of the modally necessary Apex Network provides a more robustly realist foundation. Where Kitcher's progress is defined by functional enhancement relative to a historical starting point, our framework grounds progress in convergence toward an objective, mind-independent structure of viability. This offers a stronger defense against charges of historicism or relativism.

**Rationale:** Removed bold from "Objection:" prefixes for cleaner formatting. Maintains readability while reducing emphasis on headers.

### 7. Removed Bold from Section 5.6 Header and Subheader
**Location:** Section 5.6 (Principled Limitations).

**Original Text:**
```
**The Viable Evil Possibility:** If a deeply repugnant system achieved genuinely low brittleness (minimal coercive costs, stable demographics, innovation, adaptation), the framework would acknowledge it as viable, though not necessarily just by other standards.

**Example:** A hypothetical perfectly internalized caste system where lower castes genuinely accept their position (minimal coercion), with no demographic stress, stable innovation, and low enforcement costs—yet intuitively morally repugnant.
```

**Modified Text:**

**Rationale:** Removed bold from headers for consistency with other sections. "The Viable Evil Possibility" is a subsection title, not requiring bold.

## Impact on Paper Quality
