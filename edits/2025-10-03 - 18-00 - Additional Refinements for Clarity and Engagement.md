# Summary of Additional Refinements

## Overview
Implemented four additional refinement tasks to enhance the paper's clarity, engagement, and scholarly depth: terminology consistency, vocabulary variation, visual structure improvements, and contemporary citations.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Terminology Consistency
- Verified and maintained consistent capitalization (e.g., "brittleness" lowercase except sentence starts) and italics for key terms (*Consensus Network*, *Apex Network*, *Standing Predicate*).
- Ensured uniform formatting throughout the manuscript.

### 2. Vary Vocabulary
- Replaced select instances of "brittleness" with "fragility" to reduce repetition and improve readability.
- Specific changes:
  - Section 2.6: "diagnostic of brittleness" → "diagnostic of fragility"
  - Section 4.6: "suppress indicators of brittleness" → "suppress indicators of fragility"
- Maintained semantic precision while varying language.

### 3. Visual Structure
- Reviewed dense paragraphs for potential bullet list conversion.
- Confirmed existing bullet formatting in key sections (coherence virtues in 3.2, three-level truth framework in 4.3, convergent core/pluralist frontier in 4.4) was already optimal.
- No additional conversions needed as current structure provides good visual breaks.

### 4. Additional Contemporary Citations
- Added Pritchard (2016) "Epistemic Risk" to references.md in Chicago format.
- Integrated Pritchard citation in Section 3.1 to connect the framework's risk assessment to contemporary epistemic risk literature.
- Added Zollman (2013) reference (already in bibliography) to Section 6.2, linking network epistemology to the framework's evolutionary approach.
- These additions strengthen the paper's engagement with current philosophical debates.

## Rationale and Impact
These refinements improve the manuscript's professionalism and reader engagement without altering core arguments. Vocabulary variation prevents fatigue, consistent terminology aids comprehension, visual structure enhances scannability, and contemporary citations demonstrate awareness of ongoing research. The changes maintain the paper's academic tone while making it more accessible and compelling for peer reviewers.

## Quality Standards Maintained
- **Conciseness**: Changes are minimal and targeted.
- **Precision**: Vocabulary substitutions preserve meaning.
- **Scholarly Depth**: New citations add relevant contemporary context.
- **Readability**: Improved flow without redundancy.

Total changes: 4 targeted edits across the manuscript.
