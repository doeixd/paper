# Summary of Edits

## Scope

Integrated selected high-value conceptual points from `sources/Software in the Natural World.md` into `real-patterns-as-closure.md` to strengthen formal coherence and reviewer resilience.

## What Changed

1. Added explicit statement that informational closure and causal closure coincide within the formal setup, and linked this directly to the status of leakiness diagnostics.
2. Clarified in the lumpability section that strong lumpability is sufficient for causal closure in the Markov template, not universally necessary.
3. Added a guardrail distinguishing computational closure from informational/interventional closure, and stated that computational adequacy alone is insufficient for the paper's objecthood criterion.
4. Added a concise controllability consequence: where closure holds, macro-level control can approach optimal controllability for the admissible intervention class.
5. Added a future-work extension on theory-space structure: studying nested closure-supporting coarse-grainings as an architecture rather than isolated candidates.

## Rationale

- These additions sharpen links between formal machinery and philosophical claims.
- They reduce risk of reviewer objections that the paper conflates computational success with causal autonomy.
- They preserve the paper's current scope while improving conceptual precision.

## Style and Standards

- No em dashes introduced.
- No pseudo-quantification introduced.
- Mathematical notation retained in LaTeX delimiters.
