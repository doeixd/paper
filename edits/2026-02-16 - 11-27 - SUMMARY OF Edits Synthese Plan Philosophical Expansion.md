## Scope

Expanded `real-patterns-need-closure-SYNTHESE-PLAN.md` with deeper philosophical detail and explicit argumentative-move guidance.

## What Was Added

1. Philosophical commitments and dialectical posture section.
2. Explicit statement of the paper's main philosophical move as a linear sequence.
3. Additional required conclusion moves.
4. "Argumentative moves that must be explicit" section.
5. Distinction map to avoid reviewer-level equivocations.
6. Positioning and literature-dialogue move sections.
7. Philosophical coherence audit step in drafting workflow.
8. Synthese-facing referee stress-test prompts.
9. Practical do/don't drafting patterns for argument control.

## Rationale

The update makes the planning document more operational for high-stakes drafting. It now specifies not only what to include, but how each philosophical move should function in the manuscript and how to test resilience before submission.
