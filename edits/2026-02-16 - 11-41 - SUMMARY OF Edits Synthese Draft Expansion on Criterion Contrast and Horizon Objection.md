## Scope

Further expansion pass on `real-patterns-need-closure-SYNTHESE.md` to strengthen criterion articulation and close additional foreseeable reviewer objections.

## What Was Added

1. New Section 3.3 on compression versus closure.
   - Clarifies functional division between descriptive economy and transition autonomy.
   - Reinforces that closure, not compression alone, carries ontological burden.

2. New Section 4.10 conceptual near-tie contrast.
   - Shows how two partitions can look similar on short-horizon fit yet diverge on closure under admissible interventions.
   - Makes explicit where the criterion produces distinct ontology verdicts.

3. New objection section 5.11 on horizon-relativity.
   - Addresses worry that horizon indexing trivializes passage conditions.
   - Clarifies pre-specification and robustness expectations and downgrade consequences.

## Rationale

This pass improves philosophical legibility by making key discriminations explicit and by preempting a common reviewer strategy that targets timescale indexing as a loophole.
