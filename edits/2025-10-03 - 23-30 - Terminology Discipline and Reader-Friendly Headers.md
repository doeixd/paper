# Summary of Edits: Terminology Discipline and Reader-Friendly Headers

## Overview
This edit session implemented two improvements for better readability and engagement: disciplined use of terminology to avoid repetition, and more transparent section headers.

## Changes Made

### 1. Terminology Discipline
**Brittleness Alternation**: Replaced select instances of "brittleness" with synonyms to reduce fatigue while preserving the core concept.
- Abstract: "systemic brittleness" → "systemic fragility"
- Introduction: "Miasma theory's brittleness" → "Miasma theory's fragility"
- Introduction: "low brittleness" → "low fragility"

**Systemic Costs Shortening**: Shortened "systemic costs" to "costs" in places after the concept is established, for concision.
- Introduction: "minimize systemic costs over time" → "minimize costs over time"
- Section 2.3: "accumulation of Systemic Costs" → "accumulation of costs"
- Section 2.4: "accumulated systemic costs" → "accumulated costs"

**Rationale**: "Brittleness" is a key metaphor but overused; synonyms add variety without losing meaning. "Systemic costs" can be abbreviated once defined, improving flow.

### 2. Reader-Friendly Section Headers
**Section 3**: Added main header "## **3. Why Some Systems Collapse**" before subsections, replacing the conceptual "The Logic of Systemic Viability" with a more accessible title.
**Section 4.2**: Changed "### **4.2 The Apex Network: An Emergent Structure of Viability**" to "### **4.2 Toward an Emergent Conception of Truth**"

**Rationale**: Original headers were abstract; new ones are more transparent and engaging, signaling content clearly to readers while maintaining academic tone.

## Overall Impact
These changes enhance readability by reducing repetition and making the structure more navigable. The paper remains rigorous but feels less dense, improving accessibility for reviewers without altering substantive claims or citations.
