# 2025-12-05 - 11:25 - Normativity Section Integration

## Summary of Changes

Integrated content from `arch_v16.2.md` Section 3.1 ("Grounding Epistemic Norms in Systemic Viability") into `final.md`.

## What Changed

### Added new subsection 6.3.1 in `final.md`

Location: After Section 6.3 "A Realist Corrective to Neopragmatism" (line 691)

### Content Added

The new subsection addresses the **normativity objection** (Kim 1988): the charge that a descriptive account of how we reason cannot ground a prescriptive account of how we *ought* to reason.

The section provides two arguments:

1. **Constitutive Argument**: Any system engaged in cumulative, inter-generational inquiry must maintain sufficient stability to persist. Low-brittleness is therefore not an optional value but an inescapable structural constraint on the practice of inquiry itself.

2. **Instrumental Argument**: The framework makes a falsifiable, empirical claim that high-brittleness networks are statistically more likely to collapse. This grounds a conditional recommendation: *if* you want long-term stability, *then* adopt principles that demonstrably lower brittleness.

### Why This Section Was Needed

Section 6.3 already engaged with Putnam (2002) and Lynch (2009) regarding charges that pragmatism conflates epistemic and practical values. However, the original `final.md` lacked the explicit defense structure (constitutive + instrumental arguments) that was present in `arch_v16.2.md`. Adding this subsection:

1. Strengthens the paper's response to a major objection (Kim's normativity objection)
2. Provides the philosophical grounding for why "epistemic progress" and "better network" are not subjective value judgments but technical descriptions of systemic performance
3. Connects to Quine's engineering model through the Moghaddam (2013) citation

### Reference Added

Added to the references section:

> Moghaddam, Soroush. 2013. "Confronting the Normativity Objection: W.V. Quine's Engineering Model and Michael A. Bishop and J.D. Trout's Strategic Reliabilism." Master's thesis, University of Victoria.

Kim (1988) was already present in the references.
