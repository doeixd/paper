# Summary of Edits

## Scope

Revised `real-patterns-as-closure.md` based on the targeted review to improve publishability, technical defensibility, and objection resilience.

## Key Revisions Implemented

1. Tightened the abstract and moved the novelty move earlier by foregrounding strong lumpability as the anti-gerrymandering criterion.
2. Added a scope clarification in Section 2.2 that the paper's non-Platonist stance is not eliminativism about mathematics, but a domain focus on world-implemented macro-objecthood.
3. Strengthened Section 4.1 with a qualification that strong lumpability is decisive in the Markov template, while broader cases can be handled through enriched histories or state augmentation.
4. Rewrote Section 4.3 to include a symbolic toy transition pattern (with $\alpha, \beta, \gamma, \delta$) and explicit partition comparison, so closure success and failure are operationally visible.
5. Expanded Section 5.2 with a procedural rule for "low leakiness": fixed horizon and intervention class, then comparative evaluation across candidate coarse-grainings.
6. Strengthened Section 9.2 by making the interventionist ontology commitment explicit as theory-laden, and by clarifying that prediction alone does not entail existence.
7. Updated Section 9.4 to connect scope control with the companion one-closure-two-sources framing.
8. Added an explicit framework failure condition in the conclusion: repeated closure failure across specified regimes should downgrade or withdraw objecthood claims.

## Rationale

- The revisions close the main vulnerabilities identified in review: under-specified toy operationalization, potential overreach about lumpability, and insufficiently explicit meta-commitments.
- The new toy example now demonstrates criterion bite without pseudo-quantification.
- The paper now better anticipates skeptical referee concerns while preserving concise prose and conceptual focus.

## Style and Standards Checks

- No em dashes introduced.
- Mathematical variables and expressions kept in LaTeX delimiters.
- No pseudo-quantified historical or hypothetical claims.
- Examples remain conceptual illustrations, not framed as empirical proof.
