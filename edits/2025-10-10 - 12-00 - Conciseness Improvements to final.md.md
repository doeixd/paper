# Summary of Conciseness Improvements to final.md

## Overview
This edit session focused on improving conciseness in `final.md` by applying three specific guidelines:
1. **Combine Redundant Sentences:** Merge sentences that restate the same point
2. **Eliminate Transitional Jargon:** Remove phrases like "In this way," "This section has argued that," etc.
3. **Favor Verbs over Nouns:** Replace noun-heavy phrases with verb-focused alternatives

The changes enhance readability and flow while maintaining the paper's academic rigor and substantive content.

## Specific Changes Made

### Introduction Section
- **Combined redundant sentences:** Merged "Coherentists have offered responses... but most rely on internalist resources that lack external constraints. This paper proposes an alternative..." into a single, more concise statement.
- **Eliminated transitional jargon:** Removed "In this way" and changed "This paper grounds" to "We ground".
- **Favored verbs over nouns:** Changed "grounds coherence in demonstrated viability" to "grounding coherence in demonstrated viability".

### Core Concepts Section (Section 2)
- **Eliminated transitional jargon:** Changed "Following naturalized epistemology... this framework shifts" to "Following naturalized epistemology... we shift".
- **Favored verbs over nouns:** Changed "addresses Kim's normativity objection" to "responds to Kim's normativity objection".

### Methodology Section (Section 3)
- **Eliminated transitional jargon:** Changed "This framing positions the framework as" to "We frame the approach as".
- **Favored verbs over nouns:** Changed "provides a strong, evidence-based signal" to "strongly signals".

### Emergent Structure Section (Section 4)
- **Eliminated transitional jargon:** Changed "The logic of viability... provides selective pressure" to "The logic of viability... selects for".
- **Favored verbs over nouns:** Changed "This section builds" to "We build".

### Conclusion Section
- **Combined redundant sentences:** Merged multiple sentences about the framework's development and contributions.
- **Eliminated transitional jargon:** Removed "The result is a form of Systemic Externalism that offers" and restructured.
- **Favored verbs over nouns:** Changed "By systematically studying" to "Systematically studying" and "we can discern" to "discerns".

## Rationale for Changes
- **Combine Redundant Sentences:** Eliminated unnecessary repetition that made the text wordier without adding clarity.
- **Eliminate Transitional Jargon:** Removed filler phrases that didn't contribute substantive content, making the prose more direct.
- **Favor Verbs over Nouns:** Replaced passive, noun-heavy constructions with active, verb-focused language to increase dynamism and conciseness.

## Impact
