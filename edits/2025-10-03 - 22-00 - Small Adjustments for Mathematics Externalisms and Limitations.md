# Summary of Edits: Small Adjustments for Mathematics, Externalisms, and Limitations

## Overview
This edit session implemented three targeted improvements to address specific reviewer feedback: expanding the discussion of mathematics application, developing relations to other externalist approaches, and adding potential limitations for future research.

## Changes Made

### 1. Expanded Mathematics Discussion (Section 6.4)
**Location**: Section 6.4, Scope limitation paragraph  
**Deletion**: Brief mention of mathematics requiring further development  
**Replacement**: Added detailed explanation of how brittleness applies to pure mathematics through internal inefficiencies like proof complexity growth and axiomatic inconsistencies, with examples comparing mathematical paradigms  
**Rationale**: The original brief mention in Section 1 was underdeveloped. This expansion provides concrete examples and metrics, preempting objections about the framework's applicability to abstract domains while maintaining humility about its speculative nature.

### 2. Developed Relation to Other Externalist Approaches (New Subsection 6.5)
**Location**: After Section 6.4  
**Deletion**: None (new subsection)  
**Replacement**: Added "6.5 Relation to Other Externalist Approaches" comparing Systemic Externalism to process reliabilism, virtue epistemology, and social epistemology  
**Rationale**: The paper discussed relations to coherentism and evolutionary approaches but lacked explicit positioning relative to other externalisms. This addition clarifies the framework's unique macro-level focus while showing complementarity, addressing potential confusion about its externalist credentials.

### 3. Added Potential Limitations Discussion (Section 6.4)
**Location**: Section 6.4, after Power Dynamics  
**Deletion**: None (new point)  
**Replacement**: Added "Potential Limitations and Future Research" discussing probabilistic claims, automated detection, cross-cultural universality, and micro-epistemological integration  
**Rationale**: The existing limitations were scope-focused. This addition provides balanced caveats about the framework's probabilistic nature and research gaps, demonstrating scholarly caution while suggesting productive avenues for future work.

## Overall Impact
These changes maintain the paper's concise, authoritative tone while addressing reviewer concerns proactively. The additions are brief and targeted, avoiding unnecessary length while enhancing the framework's defensibility. Citations were checked for consistency (none added, existing ones sufficient). The edits preserve existing qualifications and defenses throughout.
