# Summary of Edits to Section 10 for Prose Style and Boldface Removal

## Date and Time
2025-11-25 - 12-15

## Changes Made
- Converted the numbered summary list into flowing prose paragraphs to make the section more narrative and less list-like.
- Removed all boldface formatting (**) from key terms in the summary and bullet points.
- Integrated the bullet point sections ("What Remains Unexplained" and "What the Framework Achieves") into continuous paragraphs, eliminating the colon headings and list structures.
- Maintained the overall structure with paragraph breaks for readability while ensuring a prose-like flow.

## Rationale
The original section used a structured list and bullet points, which could feel fragmented in an academic conclusion. Converting to prose enhances readability and aligns with the preference for clear, measured academic tone without unnecessary formatting. Removing boldface reduces emphasis that might distract from the content, promoting concision and simplicity. These changes preserve the philosophical precision and qualifications while making the conclusion more engaging and cohesive.

## Impact
The revised section reads as a unified conclusion rather than a series of lists, improving flow and maintaining the authoritative yet humble tone. No substantive claims were altered; the focus was on presentation to better suit academic philosophy paper conventions.
