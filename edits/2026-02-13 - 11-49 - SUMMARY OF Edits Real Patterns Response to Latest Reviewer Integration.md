# Summary of Edits

## Scope

Implemented a targeted integration pass on `real-patterns-as-closure.md` based on the latest reviewer notes, focusing on controlled/interventional clarity, guardrails for weird partitions, and stronger diagnostics framing.

## Major Revisions

1. Tightened abstract wording so "non-gerrymandering" is explicitly defined as macro-transition autonomy.
2. Added an explicit commitment structure near the criterion statement:
   - primary ontological condition: interventional invariance across micro-realizations,
   - secondary epistemic test: predictive closure proxy when intervention data are sparse.
3. Added a concise paragraph clarifying what is adopted from computational mechanics and what is added in this paper (intervention-class restriction and primary interventional standard).
4. Strengthened Section 4.4 with additional guardrails:
   - require robustness across modest horizon/regime shifts,
   - prefer the coarsest partition among equally robust candidates.
5. Added explicit priority sentence in leakiness section: interventional estimates take priority when feasible.
6. Added new subsection `5.6 Failure modes and diagnostics` that consolidates:
   - predictive/interventional divergence,
   - finite-sample estimator bias,
   - partial-observability failure,
   and gives a mitigation protocol.
7. Added a concrete inadmissible-intervention example in Section 9.1 to make physical admissibility constraints less abstract.

## Rationale

- These edits make the logical hierarchy of the framework easier to parse and harder to misread as instrumentalism.
- The new failure-modes section improves practical credibility by linking diagnostics to decision behavior under uncertainty.
- Guardrails for weird/disjunctive partitions now reduce likely reviewer concern about baroque closure claims.

## Style and Standards

- No em dashes introduced.
- No pseudo-quantification introduced.
- Mathematical notation remains in LaTeX delimiters.
