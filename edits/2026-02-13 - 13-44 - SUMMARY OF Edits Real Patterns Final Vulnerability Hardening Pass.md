# Summary of Edits

## Scope

Applied a targeted hardening pass to `real-patterns-as-closure.md` to address final reviewer concerns about admissibility load-bearing work, regime dependence, weird-partition pluralism, operationalization expectations, and the compression/closure relation.

## Major Revisions

1. Added explicit admissibility-dispute handling in Section 3.3 with concrete examples and an adjudication rule grounded in physical implementability and regime preservation.
2. Added new Section `3.6 Compression and closure` to state clear logical relations:
   - compressibility is useful but not sufficient,
   - closure is the stronger ontological condition,
   - compression often functions as practical precondition for closure testing.
3. Expanded Section 4.4 with an explicit constrained-pluralism statement:
   - multiple closed partitions can be real at different grains,
   - robustness and minimality rank explanatory utility without collapsing to one partition.
4. Expanded Section 5.1 with ontic-versus-epistemic regime dependence distinction to prevent relativism misreadings.
5. Added an explicit scope clarification in Section 5.3: the paper provides an operational template and stylized worked setup, while full benchmark computation is left as direct future work.

## Rationale

- These edits focus on the paper's remaining pressure points while preserving scope and argument architecture.
- The framework now states more clearly where realism claims are world-anchored, where pluralism is allowed, and how diagnostics should be interpreted.

## Style and Standards

- No em dashes introduced.
- No pseudo-quantification introduced.
- Variables remain in LaTeX delimiters.
