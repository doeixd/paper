## Scope

This was a micro-edit pass on `real-patterns-as-closure.md` focused on rhetorical navigation and objection preemption. No substantive thesis changes were made.

## What Changed

1. Repeated the core closure criterion in high-friction locations.
   - Added a canonical criterion sentence in Section 3.1.
   - Repeated the same criterion at the start of Section 5.1 and Section 7.

2. Clarified the role of strong lumpability.
   - Added a signpost before Section 3.1.1 stating that strong lumpability is a clean sufficient benchmark in the exact Markov case, not the metaphysical criterion itself.

3. Made the admissibility reply more visible.
   - Added a short in-line signpost in Section 3.3 that states the interest-relativity reply in one place: admissibility is physically constrained and fixed before ontology verdicts, then robustness is evaluated across nearby admissible specifications.

4. Clarified the default role of leakiness.
   - Added a sentence in Section 5.2 that leakiness defaults to the canonical quantity, while kernel divergence and predictive gain function as estimators or proxies when direct estimation is limited.

5. Scoped the composition section explicitly.
   - Added a one-sentence scope fence at the start of Section 8.4 clarifying that the section is not a complete mereology, but a closure-based criterion for macro-object explanatory targeting in regime.

## Rationale

The goal was to make defenses easier to see at first pass, especially for skeptical readers. These edits improve baton-pass clarity and reduce avoidable misreadings without changing the paper's philosophical commitments.
