# Review of Woodward (2021): *Causation with a Human Face*

**Focus:** Chapters 5 (Invariance) and 8 (Proportionality)

## Key Concepts & Reconstruction

### 1. Invariance as a Graded Property (Ch. 5)
Woodward explicitly frames invariance not just as a threshold for causality (satisfying minimal interventionist criteria) but as a **dimension of gradation** for distinguishing "better" or "more paradigmatic" causal relationships.

> "A causal relationship is relatively more invariant to the extent that the candidate cause acts in the same way with respect to the effect of interest across different circumstances." (p. 229)

He distinguishes two failure modes:
1.  **Violation:** The relationship is falsified (e.g., $F = ma$ fails at relativistic speeds).
2.  **Failure to Apply:** The relationship is silent or inapplicable (e.g., a specific law doesn't cover a new regime).

Crucially, he links **variable choice** to invariance: we choose variables to maximize the range of invariance.

### 2. Proportionality as Variable Choice (Ch. 8)
Woodward defends proportionality against critics (like Shapiro & Sober) by framing it as a criterion for **variable choice** rather than a metaphysical necessity for truth. He defines Proportionality (P) as minimizing two defects:
1.  **Falsity:** Asserting a dependency that doesn't exist (e.g., "Scarlet causes pecking" implies non-scarlet red doesn't, which is false if all red causes pecking).
2.  **Omission:** Failing to represent a dependency that does exist.

> "A choice of variable $V_i$... satisfies proportionality better than an alternative... to the extent that those dependency claims avoid falsity and omission." (p. 369)

This "omission" defect maps neatly onto the "leakiness" concern in *Real Patterns Need Closure*. If a macro-variable is "leaky," it fails to capture dependencies that are present at the micro-level (or a different macro-level), thus failing proportionality.

### 3. Empirical Grounding (Ch. 7)
Woodward cites Vasilyeva et al. (2018) showing that human subjects **prefer** invariant relationships and that their "causal strength" judgments track invariance. This supports the paper's claim that seeking closure is a normative standard reflected in our cognitive architecture.

## Relevance to "Real Patterns Need Closure"

The paper argues that **closure** (specifically transition autonomy) is the criterion for macro-objecthood. Woodward (2021) provides a robust normative and empirical backing for this:

1.  **Normative:** Woodward argues we *ought* to value invariance/proportionality because it serves manipulation/control goals.
2.  **Descriptive:** He argues we *do* value it (Vasilyeva results).
3.  **Variable Choice:** He explicitly frames the problem as "choosing among candidate cause variables" (i.e., coarse-graining), which is exactly what the paper's "Admissibility" section (§2.4) is doing.

## Proposed Integration

We can strengthen the paper by explicitly citing Woodward (2021) in two places:

1.  **§2.4 (Admissibility/Variable Choice):** When discussing the "art" of choosing variables, cite Woodward (2021) Ch. 8 on proportionality as the normative standard for this choice.
2.  **§5.6 (The Conservative Objection):** Use Woodward's "graded invariance" (Ch. 5) to buttress the reply that objecthood is not binary but graded based on the stability of the pattern.

### Specific Text Proposal (for §4.1 or §5.8)

*Add to §5.8 (Reply to Conservative Objection):*
"Woodward (2021) similarly argues that while minimal interventionist criteria establish causality, 'proportionality' and 'invariance' are graded virtues that guide variable choice. Our criterion of closure can be seen as the dynamical realization of Woodward's proportionality: a macro-object is 'proportional' precisely when it minimizes the omission of dynamically relevant micro-detail."
