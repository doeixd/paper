Added project layout guidance to CLAUDE.md.

1. Documented current manuscript locations (final.md, from-beliefs-to-truth.md, etc.) and flagged paper.md as deprecated so contributors stop referencing it.
2. Captured key directories (references.md, edits/, sources/, scripts/, releases/) and their usage rules, reminding future editors to rely on the justfile for automation and to keep CLAUDE.md aligned with AGENTS.md.
