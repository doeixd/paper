# Summary of Edits

## Scope

Applied a final readability-focused structure pass to `real-patterns-as-closure.md` without changing substantive claims.

## What Changed

1. Reframed the closure definition into a clearer two-test structure (predictive test, interventional test) while preserving the same formal content.
2. Tightened local phrasing in the Markov exact block to improve flow and reduce cognitive load.
3. Added a plain-language bridge sentence in Section 3.2 after the $\varepsilon/\upsilon$ formulation.
4. Converted the practical-failure sentence in Section 5.5 into a short numbered list for faster scanning.
5. Rewrote the Hoel relation paragraph in Section 8.2 into explicit "Agreement" and "Difference" components to improve interpretability.

## Rationale

- These edits target comprehension and reviewer scanability in the densest technical sections.
- No arguments, standards, or criteria were weakened or removed.

## Style and Standards

- No em dashes introduced.
- No pseudo-quantification introduced.
- Mathematical notation remains in LaTeX delimiters.
