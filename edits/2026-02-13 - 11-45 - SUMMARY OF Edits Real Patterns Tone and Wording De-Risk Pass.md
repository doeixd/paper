# Summary of Edits

## Scope

Applied a language-only polish pass to `real-patterns-as-closure.md` to reduce avoidable tone triggers and potential hostile misreadings while preserving the argument.

## Key Wording Revisions

1. Replaced "criterion with bite" with "discriminating criterion" for a more neutral academic tone.
2. Replaced "pathological composites" framing in roadmap and section heading with "dynamically incoherent composites" to align rhetoric with formal criteria.
3. Rewrote the key Section 6.1 sentence to avoid "fails by construction" phrasing and instead tie failure explicitly to stated closure tests.
4. Added a clarifying sentence under regime-dependent ontology: this is not metaphysical annihilation, but regime-sensitive closure licensing.

## Rationale

- These edits lower the chance of reviewer reaction to loaded phrasing.
- The paper now speaks more consistently in criterion-based rather than rhetorical terms.
- Substantive claims and formal commitments were intentionally left unchanged.

## Style and Standards

- No em dashes introduced.
- No pseudo-quantification introduced.
- Mathematical notation preserved in LaTeX delimiters.
