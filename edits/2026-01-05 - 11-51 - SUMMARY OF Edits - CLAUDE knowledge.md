Added synthesized guidance from The Reality of Wholes corpus to CLAUDE.md.

1. Highlighted Causal Closure, constraint-determined boundaries, and leakiness metrics drawn from the full technical paper so instructions anchor reality claims in the established tests.
2. Captured illustrative heuristics from the magazine version (Two-Level Test, compression test, dimensional closure) to guide future explanatory moves without re-reading the whole article.
3. Summarized the category-theoretic appendix so we can reference $\mathcal{C}_{pred}$, faithfulness, initial objects, and the constraint/rule/whole distinction whenever formal justification is needed.
4. Recorded these updates to make future editors aware of where to source arguments and how to keep the papers in conceptual sync.
