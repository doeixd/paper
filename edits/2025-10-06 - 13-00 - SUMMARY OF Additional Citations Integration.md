# Summary of Additional Citations Integration (2025-10-06)

## Overview
Following the first round of citation integration, identified and integrated 3 additional citations from the missing list that fit existing content in final.md without requiring new sections or subsections.

## Selection Criteria
From the remaining missing citations list, only integrated those where:
1. The underlying argument already exists in final.md
2. Integration requires only adding a citation, not expanding content
3. No new sections or subsections needed

## Citations Not Integrated (and why)
The following citations from other.md were **intentionally excluded** because they appear only in sections that don't exist in final.md:
- **Boyd (1990)**: Only in extended "Intellectual Lineage" section discussing Darwin vs. population genetics
- **Dewey (1938)**: Only in extended "Intellectual Lineage" section
- **Gaifman & Snir (1982)**: Only in detailed Bayesian convergence discussion not present in final.md
- **Howson & Urbach (1993)**: Only in extended Bayesian epistemology discussion
- **Hull (1988)**: Only in extended evolutionary epistemology discussion
- **James (1907)**: Only in extended "Intellectual Lineage" section
- **Joyce (1998, 2010)**: Only in detailed Bayesian/imprecise probabilities discussion
- **Kelly (1996)**: Only in extended Formal Learning Theory discussion
- **Plantinga (1993)**: Only in extended coherentism objections discussion
- **Popper (1979)**: Different work cited in extended evolutionary epistemology discussion

**Note:** Zollman (2013) was already cited in final.md at line 492 in the network epistemology discussion.

## Citations Integrated

### 1. **Lehrer (1990)** - Coherentist Responses
- **Location**: Section 1, Introduction (line 11)
- **Context**: Existing discussion of coherentist responses to isolation objection
- **Integration**: Added to list "(Lehrer 1990; Olsson 2005; Kvanvig 2012)"
- **Rationale**: Lehrer's *Theory of Knowledge* is a foundational coherentist text that should be cited alongside other major coherentist responses
- **Bibliographic Entry**: Added full entry to references.md

### 2. **Popper (1959)** - Negative Methodology
- **Location**: Section 4.1, Negative Methodology (line 170)
- **Context**: Existing phrase "Following Popperian insight"
- **Integration**: Added "(Popper 1959)" after "Popperian insight"
- **Rationale**: Direct reference to Popperian falsificationism was uncited; this is Popper's foundational work on falsification and the asymmetry between verification and falsification
- **Bibliographic Entry**: Already in references.md

### 3. **Kelly (2005)** - Higher-Order Evidence and Bayesian Priors
- **Location**: Section 7, Final Defense (line 522)
- **Context**: Existing phrase "In a Bayesian framework"
- **Integration**: Added "(Kelly 2005)" after "Bayesian framework"
- **Rationale**: Kelly's work on disagreement and higher-order evidence is directly relevant to how diagnosed network health affects rational priors. The paper already discusses how brittleness assessment provides higher-order evidence for belief revision, which is Kelly's core contribution
- **Bibliographic Entry**: Already in references.md

## Philosophy of Integration

### Minimal Intervention Approach
- Only added citations where arguments already exist
- No new content added, only scholarly attribution
- Maintained concise style of final.md
- Avoided forcing citations where condensation was intentional

### Respecting Editorial Choices
final.md represents a deliberate condensation of arguments from paper.md and other.md. The "Intellectual Lineage" section and extended Bayesian discussions were intentionally removed. Adding those citations back would undermine the editorial decision to streamline the paper.

### Quality Over Completeness
Better to have 3 well-placed, contextually appropriate citations than to force 10+ citations into content that doesn't support them.

## Files Modified
1. **final.md**: 3 in-text citations integrated across 3 sections
2. **references.md**: 1 bibliographic entry added (Lehrer 1990)

## Total Citation Integration Summary (Both Rounds)
- **First round**: 13 citations integrated
- **Second round**: 3 citations integrated
- **Total**: 16 citations properly attributed in final.md
- **Bibliographic entries added**: 3 (Goldman 1999, Pritchard 2016 corrected, Lehrer 1990)

## Result
final.md now has significantly stronger scholarly attribution while maintaining its deliberate concision and focus. The paper properly cites foundational works (Campbell, Bradie, Lehrer, Popper, Kelly) and situates itself within established debates without unnecessary expansion.
