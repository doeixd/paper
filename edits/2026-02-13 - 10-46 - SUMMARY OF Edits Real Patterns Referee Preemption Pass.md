# Summary of Edits

## Scope

Applied a focused referee-preemption revision pass to `real-patterns-as-closure.md` based on critical feedback about generality, overclaim risk, and criterion clarity.

## High-Impact Changes

1. Added an early anti-instrumentalism constraint argument in the introduction: intervention classes are constrained by embodied measurement/control limits (locality, bandwidth, thermodynamic cost), not arbitrary preference.
2. Added scope clarification in Section 2.2 and a contrast-class sentence distinguishing stipulated closure in formal systems from induced closure in empirical dynamics.
3. Added a compact formal anchor in Section 3.1 with:
   - a definition of closure relative to horizon and intervention class,
   - a Markov-case lemma linking strong lumpability to macro-transition autonomy.
4. Clarified in Section 3.2 that informational diagnostics and interventional interpretation are jointly used, avoiding a prediction-only reading.
5. Refined Section 4.1 wording so strong lumpability is presented as the canonical exact criterion in the Markov template, with explicit generalization to enriched histories/state augmentation outside first-order Markov cases.
6. Upgraded the toy example in Section 4.3 into a symbolic transition specification (parameters $\alpha, \beta, \gamma, \delta$), then demonstrated success/failure partition logic explicitly.
7. Added procedural guidance for "low leakiness" in Section 5.2: fixed regime + comparative coarse-graining test.
8. Strengthened Section 6.2 by defining "high maintenance" as repeated forced refinement of within-class distinctions to preserve predictive accuracy.
9. Softened potential overclaim in Section 8.2 by presenting strong lumpability as a natural exact formalization in Markov settings, not as a universal one-shot equivalence.
10. Added explicit framework failure condition in conclusion: repeated closure failure across specified regimes should downgrade objecthood claims.

## Rationale

- These edits directly target likely referee attacks without changing the core thesis.
- The manuscript now better distinguishes exact template claims from general closure claims.
- The paper's standards are now explicit at each vulnerable point: definition, test, scope, and failure condition.

## Style and Constraint Checks

- No em dashes introduced.
- Variables and formulas remain in LaTeX delimiters.
- No pseudo-quantification introduced.
- Conceptual illustrations remain non-evidential in framing.
