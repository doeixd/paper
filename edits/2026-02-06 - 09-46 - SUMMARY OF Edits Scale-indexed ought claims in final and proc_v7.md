## Revision Summary

This revision integrates a direct clarification requested by the author: ought-claims are scale-dependent, and the relevant agent-set must be made explicit.

### What changed

1. **`proc_v7.md` now states scale-dependence explicitly in Section 4.4**
   - Added a framing paragraph before the three levels: every ought-claim is indexed to an agent-set, even when implicit.
   - Added a concise three-scale schema:
     - individual-scale oughts,
     - network-scale oughts,
     - maximally shared social oughts.
   - Stated default interpretive rule: unqualified moral claims are read at the maximally shared social scale.

2. **`proc_v7.md` now links scale-indexing to local/global rightness**
   - Added a bridge paragraph clarifying that local correctness at narrow scales can be overridden at wider scales when broader constraints are included.
   - Preserved Apex Network as the regulative standard for maximally shared claims.

3. **`final.md` now includes a matching epistemic-scope clarification**
   - In Section 6.3.1, added a concise note that epistemic oughts also vary by scale (individual, institution, public).
   - Added default rule for this paper: "we ought" typically refers to maximally shared standards of cumulative public inquiry unless otherwise specified.

### Why this improves the papers

- Prevents ambiguity about who a normative claim is for.
- Reduces reviewer risk that "right/wrong" claims are read as unqualified universal claims when they are actually scope-indexed.
- Preserves robust objectivity while keeping fallibilist humility: local warrant and global alignment are related but not identical.
