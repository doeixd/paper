# Summary of Edits

## Scope

Applied a targeted revision pass to `real-patterns-as-closure.md` to address the latest accept-with-major-revisions referee comments.

## Major Changes

1. Tightened closure definition by adding explicit instantiations of "approximate" directly at the definition site:
   - bounded conditional mutual information,
   - bounded within-class transition-kernel divergence,
   - bounded out-of-regime predictive regret under admissible interventions.
2. Softened and qualified the informational-closure/causal-closure bridge in Section 3.2 to avoid over-strong equivalence claims outside idealized settings.
3. Strengthened Section 6.1 with a short explicit argument from subsystem independence to heterogeneous onward transition profiles and thus high leakiness in disjunctive aggregates.
4. Added scoring-rule precision in Section 5.2 by specifying predictive-gain proxies should use a proper scoring rule.
5. Further tightened epistemic posture in Section 7 with conditional phrasing for meteorology/biology claims.
6. Softened the embodied-constraints sentence in the introduction from assertion to plausibility framing to avoid overclaim without additional empirical citation burden.

## Rationale

- These edits directly target residual reviewer vulnerabilities: under-specified approximation language, bridge overstatement risk, and under-argued Shoe-Moon failure logic.
- The manuscript now presents a cleaner chain from formal criterion to operational decision rule to ontological implication.

## Style and Standards

- No em dashes introduced.
- No pseudo-quantification introduced.
- Mathematical notation remains in LaTeX delimiters.
