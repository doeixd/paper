# Summary of Edits

## Scope

Created a full manuscript draft at `real-patterns-as-closure.md` from the provided publishable-style outline.

## What Was Added

1. Full paper structure with sections 0 through 10, including abstract, introduction, criterion development, objections, and conclusion.
2. A precise thesis framing real patterns as autonomous coarse-grainings, with closure as the central criterion.
3. Early conceptual disambiguation ladder (reality, pattern, instance, representation) to prevent category mistakes.
4. A formalized closure section tying macro-autonomy to transition structure over $X_t$ and $Z_t$.
5. A dedicated lumpability section presenting strong lumpability as the anti-gerrymandering constraint.
6. A toy Markov-style example with one closure-respecting partition and one failure partition, written in symbolic rather than pseudo-quantitative form.
7. A graded extension via approximate lumpability and leakiness using a conceptual information-theoretic marker $I(X_t; Z_{t+1} \mid Z_t)$.
8. Application sections on pathological composites, canonical macro-patterns (hurricanes, organisms), and borderline cases.
9. A full objections-and-replies section with scope control and explicit meta-commitments.

## Rationale

- The goal was to keep Dennett's insight while adding criterion-level precision strong enough to handle permissiveness and instrumentalism objections.
- The draft is built to be referee-resilient: explicit definitions, explicit standards, explicit limits.
- Formal language is used as a diagnostic aid and kept subordinate to the philosophical claim.

## Style and Constraint Compliance

- No em dashes.
- No pseudo-quantified historical or hypothetical claims.
- Variables are in LaTeX delimiters.
- Examples are framed as conceptual illustrations rather than empirical proof.
- Tone kept measured, assertive, and non-grandiose.

## Citation Handling

- Used existing references already present in the repository (Dennett 1991; Shalizi and Crutchfield 2001; Rosas et al. 2024; Woodward 2003; Pearl 2000).
- No `references.md` updates were required for this draft.

## Suggested Next Pass

1. Add one compact diagram/table to the toy example section for visual readability.
2. Tighten abstract length to match target venue limits exactly.
3. If needed for a technical venue, add a short appendix formalizing one approximate lumpability estimator.
