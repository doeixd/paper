Captured key guidance from proc_v7.md inside CLAUDE.md.

1. Added a knowledge entry summarizing Pragmatic Procedural Realism so revisions keep the moral-debugging thesis aligned with EPC diagnostics (brittleness tiers, C(t), P(t), Negative Canon).
2. Noted replicator/interactor distinctions, probabilistic predictions, and how to pre-empt "viable evil" objections, so ethical discussions remain faithful to the paper.
