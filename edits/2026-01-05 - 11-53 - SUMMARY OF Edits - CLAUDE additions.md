Documented the role toe.md and STYLE_GUIDE.md play in CLAUDE.md instructions.

1. Added a knowledge entry for toe.md that captures its informational-constraint framing of gravity, space, and quantum behavior so future drafts tie EPC claims to the same thermodynamic logic.
2. Added a knowledge entry for STYLE_GUIDE.md that reiterates the resilience-first editorial heuristics, formatting constraints, and validation checklist we must follow for every revision.
