## Summary of Edits: Review of Boldface Usage and Headings

### Changes Made:
1. **Fixed section numbering in Section 7**: Renumbered subsections to correct the skip from 7.1 to 7.3, changing 7.3 to 7.2, 7.4 to 7.3, and 7.5 to 7.4 for proper sequential numbering.

### Rationale:
- **Boldface Review**: Boldface is used sparingly for key defined terms (e.g., **Apex Network**, **Emergent Pragmatic Coherentism**) and metric names in lists, not overused. Headings retain ** for emphasis on titles, but not excessive.
- **Headings Review**: All headings are at correct levels (## for main sections, ### for subsections, #### for subsubsections), reflect content accurately, and numbering is now sequential and correct. No changes needed beyond numbering fix.
- Maintained existing qualifications, details, and citations.

### Impact:
- Improved structural consistency without altering content.
- Paper remains clear, authoritative, and well-organized.
