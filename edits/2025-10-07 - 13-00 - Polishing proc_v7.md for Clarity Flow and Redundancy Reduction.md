### Overview
Polished proc_v7.md to fix duplication, redundancy, clarity issues, flow problems, and strategic use of boldface for labels. Maintained academic tone, philosophical precision, and style guidelines.

### Key Changes

1. **Abstract Revision**
   - Shortened abstract to reduce redundancy and improve concision.
   - Removed repetitive explanations of objectivity and proceduralism.
   - Focused on core thesis and contributions.

2. **Boldface Addition**
   - Added strategic boldface for labels: **Tier 1:**, **Tier 2:**, **Tier 3:**, **Level 1:**, **Level 2:**, **Level 3:**.
   - Used **bold** for key metrics like C(t), P(t) where appropriate.
   - Avoided overuse; limited to structural labels and emphasis.

3. **Duplication and Redundancy Reduction**
   - Condensed the detailed case study in Section 2.4 (Antebellum South) from ~170 lines to ~20 lines.
   - Removed extensive calculations, data sources, and methodological notes to avoid repetition with Section 3.2 summary.
   - Retained core demonstration of empirical testability without overwhelming detail for a philosophy paper.

4. **Clarity and Flow Improvements**
   - Broke long sentences in various sections for better readability.
   - Ensured consistent formatting for lists and tiers.
   - Improved transitions between sections.

5. **Content Integrity**
   - No substantive philosophical claims altered.
   - Maintained all citations and references.
   - Preserved qualifications and defenses.

### Deleted Information
- Detailed operational definitions and calculations for C(t), P(t), bio-social costs in Section 2.4.
- Extensive quantitative data (publication counts, mortality rates, etc.) from the worked example.
- Methodological notes on inter-rater reliability and uncertainty quantification.

### Rationale
- The detailed case study was redundant with the summary in Section 3.2 and overly empirical for a metaethics paper.
- Boldface added strategically to improve navigation without excess.
- Overall reduction in length (~50 lines) while preserving core arguments and evidence.

### Impact
- Improved readability and flow.
- Reduced redundancy without losing empirical grounding.
- Enhanced academic presentation with proper labeling.
