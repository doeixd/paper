# Summary of Edits: New Sections 6.2-6.5 for "The Reality of Wholes"
**Date:** 2026-02-13

## What Changed

Added four new subsections to Part 6 of "The Reality of Wholes.md", inserted between the end of Section 6.1 (The Lattice of Real Patterns) and the transition to Part 7 (Where Is the Triangle?). Also added two new references (Frege 1884, Turing 1936) to both the paper's own reference section and to references.md.

### New Sections

1. **6.2 Real Patterns as Strongly Lumpable Coarse-Grainings**
   - Establishes a formal identification: Dennett's (1991) Real Patterns correspond exactly to strongly lumpable coarse-grainings of epsilon-machines in the Rosas et al. (2024) framework.
   - Maps Dennett's three criteria (compression, projectibility, observer-independence) to formal conditions (coarse-graining, causal closure, strong lumpability).
   - Distinguishes weak lumpability (fragile patterns) from strong lumpability (genuine Real Patterns).
   - Provides formal mathematical grounding for why the Shoe-Moon and phlogiston fail, complementing the epsilon/upsilon-machine argument already in Section 8.1.
   - Shows that Real Patterns form a lattice, connecting back to 6.1.

2. **6.3 The Limiting Case: Mathematical Objects as Maximally Closed Patterns**
   - Argues that mathematical objects (chess, arithmetic, logic, pi) achieve *perfect* computational closure with zero substrate contribution.
   - The epsilon-machine of a formal system captures every computation; there is no residual micro-level computation below it.
   - Positions mathematical objects as the far end of the causal closure spectrum.
   - References Part 9's five-axis framework rather than repeating it.

3. **6.4 Dissolving the Platonic Realm**
   - Uses the formal machinery from 6.2-6.3 to ground the Introduction's claim that pi is "neither Platonic nor conventional."
   - Identifies three consequences of maximal computational closure that reproduce the Platonic intuition without a Platonic realm: (1) discovery, not invention (constraint-determination); (2) independence from the physical world (substrate independence, not ontological separation); (3) necessity and eternality (temporal invariance of fully closed computation).
   - Dissolves the "access problem": no mystery about how brains access math, since mathematical patterns are instantiated in physical processes whenever those processes realize the relevant computational structure.
   - Cross-references Section 9.2 (Instantiation Thesis) rather than repeating its argument.
   - Generalizes: chess vs. mathematics differ in axiom origin (convention vs. constraint-determination), not in ontological kind.

4. **6.5 What the Spectrum Reveals**
   - Unity of the ontological spectrum: physical, biological, social, and mathematical objects are positions on a single continuum.
   - Abstract objects without Platonism: abstraction = maximal multiple realizability = maximal computational closure.
   - The nihilist's dilemma sharpens: denying lumpable patterns means denying logic itself (modus ponens as a transition in a deterministic automaton).
   - Software as bridge concept: Turing's (1936) foundational insight reinterpreted as showing mathematics and computation are two perspectives on the same structural property.

### References Added
- Frege, Gottlob. 1884. *Die Grundlagen der Arithmetik*.
- Turing, Alan M. 1936. "On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem."

## Rationale

These sections fill a gap in the paper between the formal lattice analysis (6.1) and its application to consciousness (Part 7). The key philosophical contribution is the formal identification of Real Patterns with strongly lumpable coarse-grainings (6.2), which resolves a long-standing ambiguity in Dennett's account and gives the paper a novel result to offer the literature. Sections 6.3-6.4 extend this to mathematical objects, providing a principled dissolution of Platonism that complements the Instantiation Thesis in 9.2 with formal backing. Section 6.5 draws out implications, with the nihilist's dilemma (must deny logic itself) being a particularly strong new argument.

## Alignment Decisions

- **Removed em dashes** throughout; replaced with commas, semicolons, or restructured sentences.
- **Removed the five-axis table** from 6.3 (redundant with Part 9's radar chart) and replaced with a brief cross-reference.
- **Removed the continuum-of-reality table** from 6.4 (redundant with Part 9.1 examples).
- **Cross-referenced Section 9.2** in 6.4 rather than repeating the Instantiation Thesis argument.
- **Cross-referenced Section 8.1** in 6.2 to frame the lumpability argument as deepening (not replacing) the existing response to the "too permissive" objection.
- **Trimmed the software discussion** in 6.5 since software is discussed extensively in Part 6 (lines 350-374) and Part 7 (line 433). Kept the Turing connection as genuinely new.
- **Adjusted Frege attribution**: Changed from attributing "third realm" directly to Frege 1884 (the phrase appears in Frege's 1918 "The Thought") to a more defensible phrasing about varieties of mathematical Platonism motivated since Frege.
- **Maintained measured academic tone** without grandiose claims; added qualifications where needed.
- **Preserved existing transitions**: The text at lines 486-488 (nihilist retreating to facts, transition to consciousness) still flows naturally after the new sections.
