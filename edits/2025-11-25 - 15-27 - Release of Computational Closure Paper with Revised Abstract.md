# 2025-11-25 - 15-27 - Release of Computational Closure Paper with Revised Abstract

## Summary of Changes

Successfully released the "Computational-Closure-and-the-Architecture-of-Mind.md" paper to PDF format after revising the abstract to better align with our writing style preferences.

### Key Actions Taken:

1. **Abstract Revision**: Completely rewrote the abstract to be simpler, clearer, and more aligned with academic philosophy writing standards:
   - Removed technical jargon and complex terminology
   - Added appropriate qualifications and humility
   - Anticipated reviewer objections
   - Maintained philosophical precision while improving accessibility
   - Reduced word count from 248 to 156 words for better concision

2. **Release Process**: Ran the full release pipeline to generate publication-ready PDF

### Abstract Changes Summary:
