## Scope

Continued improvement pass on `real-patterns-need-closure-SYNTHESE.md` focused on three priorities: clearer literature positioning, stronger objection architecture, and cleaner references.

## Main Changes

1. Deepened literature positioning in the introduction.
   - Added an explicit dialogue paragraph in Section 1.1 that contrasts the paper's move with Dennett, Ladyman and Ross, Rosas et al., and Kim-style exclusion pressure.
   - This makes novelty legible as a tightening and integration move, not a detached new framework.

2. Added a canonical criterion restatement.
   - New Section 2.8 gives a compact criterion formulation with fixed $L$ and $\mathcal{I}$ constraints.
   - Clarifies exact benchmark versus non-ideal estimation relation.

3. Strengthened causal-exclusion response.
   - Expanded Section 5.3 with an explicit limit statement and stronger framing of non-redundancy under target-indexed adequacy.
   - Added direct connection to Kim (2005) pressure without overclaim.

4. Upgraded references block quality.
   - Changed heading from "References (selected)" to "References".
   - Normalized entries to match house style used in `references.md`, including DOI/ISBN details where available.
   - Added Kim (2005), which is now cited in the manuscript.

## Rationale

This pass improves Synthese-facing review readiness by making the paper's conversational position clearer, increasing defensive precision in the highest-risk objection section, and reducing avoidable technical weaknesses in reference presentation.
