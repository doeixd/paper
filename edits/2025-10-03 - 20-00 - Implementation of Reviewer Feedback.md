## Summary of Edits: Implementation of Reviewer Feedback

### Changes Made:
1. **Framed Normative Brittleness More Explicitly**: Shortened the main text discussion in ยง2.6 to emphasize that the normative modality is speculative and independent, with core claims standing on epistemic justification alone. Removed reference to "unifies descriptive and normative" to avoid overreach.
2. **Expanded Scope on Pure Mathematics**: Added a brief sketch in ยง1 illustrating brittleness in mathematics via the shift from naive set theory (Russell's paradox) to ZFC, showing how it resolves brittleness through a more viable axiomatic foundation.
3. **Verified Citation**: Confirmed Sevilla et al. (2022) is present in references.md.
4. **Clarified Formalization in ยง4.2**: Expanded the definition of W_k to specify examples like "a scientific paradigm, a legal framework, or an entire society's knowledge base" for better clarity.

### Rationale:
- These edits address reviewer concerns by strengthening scholarly caution, providing concrete examples for universality claims, ensuring citations are complete, and improving accessibility of formal elements.
- Maintained humility, qualifications, and philosophical precision; no overconfidence added.
- All changes enhance clarity and defensiveness without altering core arguments.

### Impact:
- Paper better anticipates objections and demonstrates thoroughness in scope and formalism.
