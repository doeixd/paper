# 2025-11-25 - 13-00 - Summary of Redundancy Consolidation in Computational Closure Paper

## Issue Identified
The statistical/structural distinction appeared in multiple places with similar wording, creating unnecessary length and weakening the crispness of the argument.

## Solution Implemented
Consolidated all detailed explanations of the statistical/structural distinction into one definitive section (Section 2.5) and replaced redundant explanations throughout the paper with references to Section 2.5.

## Changes Made

### 1. Introduction (Lines 19, 21)
- **Before**: Detailed explanation of the distinction
- **After**: Brief mention with reference to Section 2.5

### 2. Section 3.6.2 (Lines 355-382)
- **Before**: Detailed explanation of statistical vs. structural pathways with examples
- **After**: Brief summary with reference to Section 2.5

### 3. Section 4 (Lines 455-470)
- **Before**: Repeated explanation of the distinction
- **After**: Reference to Section 2.5

### 4. Section 4A (Lines 425-427, 476-482)
- **Before**: Redundant explanations
- **After**: References to Section 2.5

### 5. Section 4B (Lines 584-590)
- **Before**: Table with repeated distinction
- **After**: Table with reference to Section 2.5

### 6. Section 9 (Line 984)
- **Before**: Brief mention without reference
- **After**: Reference to Section 2.5

### 7. Conclusion (Line 1128)
- **Before**: Brief mention without reference
- **After**: Reference to Section 2.5

## Result
- **Maintained**: Comprehensive explanation in Section 2.5 as the definitive source
- **Eliminated**: ~500+ words of redundant explanation across multiple sections
- **Improved**: Paper flow and conciseness while preserving all key information
- **Enhanced**: Reader experience by directing to the authoritative section

The paper now has a single, authoritative explanation of the statistical/structural distinction in Section 2.5, with all other mentions serving as navigational references rather than redundant explanations.
