## Overview
Applied final polish edits to proc_v7.md based on pending changes from recent edit summaries. Removed unnecessary boldface from section headers and key terms to improve readability and consistency with academic formatting guidelines. Updated Kitcher citation ISBN for accuracy. Verified all citations are properly extracted and matched.

## Specific Changes

### 1. Removed Bold from Tier Headers in Section 2.2
**Location:** Section 2.2 (Tiered Diagnostic Framework).

**Original Text:**
```
**Tier 1: Bio-Social Costs.** Direct material consequences of friction with human persistence conditions, measured by objective proxies like excess mortality/morbidity rates, chronic malnutrition, and demographic decline. Systems generating these costs fail fundamentally.

**Tier 2: Systemic Friction Costs.** Resources expended managing dissent from Tier 1 costs, measured by the Coercion Ratio (C(t)), which tracks resources spent on suppression versus production. Rising C(t) indicates high maintenance costs for flawed designs.

**Tier 3: Ideological Costs.** Informational expenses justifying Tier 1 and 2 costs, measured by Patch Velocity (P(t)), the rate of ad-hoc ideological justifications (such as divine mandates for suffering). High P(t) signals accumulating ideological debt in failing systems.

**Rationale:** Removed bold from "Tier X" labels to reduce visual clutter. These are section headers, not key terms requiring emphasis. Maintains clarity while improving publication-ready formatting.

### 2. Removed Bold from Level Headers in Section 4.4
**Location:** Section 4.4 (Three-Level Normative Justification).

**Original Text:**
```
**Level 1: Contextual Rightness (the 'Ought' of Coherence).** This is the realm of cultural relativity, where normativity follows a network's internal rules. In a 17th-century dueling society, the predicate `insults must be met with a challenge to a duel` was contextually right. Failing to issue a challenge was 'wrong' by the system's internal logic. This level provides procedural correctness without objective justification. The 'Ought of Coherence' commands: "If in this network, follow its rules." It binds locally but lacks external authority, explaining how abhorrent actions were once "right" while creating coherence traps that externalist checks must overcome.

**Level 2: Justified Rightness (the 'Ought' of Viability).** This level provides external, empirical justification based on demonstrated track records. While the dueling code was contextually right, historical diagnosis reveals catastrophic Tier 1 Bio-Social Costs (premature deaths of valuable community members) and high Tier 2 Costs (resources managing feuds and vendettas). The predicate is therefore justifiedly wrong, warranting its entry into the Negative Canon. The 'Ought of Viability' commands: "If we aim for resilient cooperation, adopt low-brittleness principles and avoid Negative Canon predicates."

**Level 3: Objective Rightness (the 'Ought' of Optimal Design).** This represents the regulative ideal and formal standard for Level 2 comparisons. The dueling predicate is objectively wrong because its high-cost nature conflicts with efficient, low-cost cooperation principles that form the Apex Network's modally necessary structure. The 'Ought of Optimal Design' represents the commands of a system that has solved for maximal viability. Principles like reciprocity that pass independent convergence tests are our strongest candidates. The dueling code demonstrably fails to achieve this solution.

**Rationale:** Removed bold from level headers for consistency with other section formatting. These are subsection titles, not requiring bold emphasis. Aligns with guidelines to avoid overuse of boldface.

### 3. Updated Kitcher Citation ISBN
**Location:** references.md

**Original Text:**
```
Kitcher, Philip. 2011. *The Ethical Project*. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press. ISBN 978-0674061442.
```

**Modified Text:**
```
Kitcher, Philip. 2011. *The Ethical Project*. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press. ISBN 9780674060195.
```

**Rationale:** Corrected ISBN to match the accurate identifier provided by the user. Ensures reference accuracy for academic integrity.

## Impact on Paper Quality
- **Formatting Consistency:** Standardized use of boldface, removing it from headers and labels where unnecessary.
- **Readability:** Reduced visual noise from over-boldface, making the text cleaner and more professional.
- **Academic Standards:** Maintained Chicago citation style, proper philosophical precision, and balanced tone.
- **Citation Accuracy:** Verified all 15 citations in proc_v7.md are properly matched to references, with updated ISBN for Kitcher.
