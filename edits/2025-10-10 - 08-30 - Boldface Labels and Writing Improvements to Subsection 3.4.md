## Section Modified
Subsection 3.4: Challenging Cases: Addressing Apparent Counterexamples

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Boldface Formatting
- **Case labels**: Added boldface to **Case 1**, **Case 2**, and **Case 3**
- **Section headers**: Added boldface to **The Challenge**, **Framework Response**, and **Conclusion** for each case
- **Sub-labels**: Added boldface to **First**, **Second**, **Third**, **Fourth** in the numbered points
- **Numbered points**: Added boldface to **1.**, **2.**, **3.**, **4.**, **5.** in the General Lessons section
- **System names**: Added boldface to ***Ottoman devşirme system***, ***Indian caste system***, and ***Brave New World scenarios***

### 2. Removed Em Dashes
Replaced all em dashes (—) with appropriate alternatives:
- "not continuous stability" → "not continuous stability" (comma)
- "cyclical rather than linear" → "cyclical rather than linear" (colon)
- List items restructured with "such as" instead of em dashes
- "voluntary cooperation with minimal internal suppression" → "voluntary cooperation with minimal internal suppression" (colon)

### 3. Improved Writing Flow and Clarity
- **Introduction**: Changed colon to "such as" for smoother flow
- **Case 1**: Added transitional phrases like "We must distinguish", "Examining...reveals", "We can identify", "We must calibrate" for better flow
- **Case 2**: Added "we must" to points for consistency and improved list formatting with "including"
- **Case 3**: Minor improvements to sentence structure and added "these cases" for better transition
- **General Lessons**: Added "They teach us several key distinctions" for smoother introduction
- **Final paragraph**: Improved punctuation and added "such as" for better list flow

## Rationale
These changes enhance readability and academic presentation by:
- Making structural elements (cases, challenges, responses) more visually distinct
- Eliminating em dashes for cleaner, more formal academic style
- Improving sentence flow and transitions for better logical progression
- Maintaining the authoritative yet accessible tone appropriate for philosophy papers

## Impact
The subsection now has improved visual hierarchy, cleaner punctuation, and smoother narrative flow while preserving all original content and citations.
