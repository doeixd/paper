## Scope

Implemented a focused improvement pass on `real-patterns-need-closure-SYNTHESE.md` based on comparison with earlier drafts and notes.

## Main Revisions

1. Added explicit anti-flexibility discipline in Section 4.
   - New `Selection Discipline` block under 4.3 states one auditable rule for upstream fixation (admissibility, state construction, horizon, diagnostics) with restart/disclosure on post hoc changes.

2. Strengthened type-token handling where downgrade rules are introduced.
   - Added a type-token reminder in 4.6 to prevent misuse of token anomalies as direct type-level refutations.

3. Consolidated objection flow to reduce checklist feel.
   - Merged admissibility circularity content into 5.1 (`Instrumentalism and Admissibility`).
   - Merged pluralism concern into 5.4 (`Autonomy, Pluralism, and Distinctiveness`).
   - Kept argument content while reducing subsection fragmentation.

4. Strengthened formal-systems clarification in 5.7.
   - Added “invented but not freely” clarification with intelligibility constraints (stable identity, compositional inference, coherent consequence).
   - Preserves stipulated-vs-induced closure distinction without opening a separate philosophy-of-math detour.

5. Tightened Section 5 framing sentence.
   - Reworded opening progression line to reduce density and improve section coherence.

## Rationale

The pass targets remaining reviewer risks: silent flexibility, level confusion, and objection-section fragmentation. It improves readability and defensibility while preserving thesis, scope, and tone.
