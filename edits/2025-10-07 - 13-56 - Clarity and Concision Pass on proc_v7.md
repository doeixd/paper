# Edit Summary: Clarity and Concision Pass on proc_v7.md
**Date**: October 7, 2025, 13:56
**File Modified**: proc_v7.md

## Overview
Conducted a comprehensive review and improvement pass focused on clarity, concision, and academic rigor while maintaining philosophical precision. The paper was already strong; this pass eliminated redundancy, tightened prose, and ensured consistent formatting.

## Major Changes

### 1. Formatting Improvements
- **Removed all em dashes** (â€”) throughout the document, replacing with hyphens (-) or parentheses as appropriate per style guidelines
- **Reduced excessive boldface** in inline section headers while maintaining essential emphasis for tiered costs and key procedural steps
- Improved readability through more consistent punctuation

### 2. Abstract and Introduction
- **Abstract**: Tightened from 9 to 7 sentences, removing redundant phrasing ("aimed at cultivating more viable social worlds" was redundant with earlier content)
- **Introduction (1.1)**: Reduced wordiness throughout
  - Changed "the ongoing project of building" to "building"
  - Simplified "EPC shows that both are justified by the same mechanism" from longer construction
  - Removed unnecessary phrase "This unified approach"
- **Scope section (1.3)**: Reordered sentences for better logical flow, removed redundant defensive language about not deriving categorical imperatives

### 3. EPC Foundations (1.1.1)
- **Systemic Brittleness Index**: Streamlined explanation while preserving technical content
- **Three-Level Framework**: Tightened each level description by 15-20%
  - Level 1: Removed redundant explanation about internal coherence
  - Level 2: Removed phrase "external validation through demonstrated performance"
  - Level 3: Simplified explanation of fallibilism
- **Entrenchment Mechanism**: Maintained content but improved flow
- **Unified Diagnostic**: Removed phrase "This approach dissolves traditional boundaries" as redundant
- **Implications**: Condensed without losing key connections to the paper's argument

### 4. Diagnostic Framework (Section 2)
- **Units of Selection (2.1)**: Changed "Claims are justified not just by internal coherence but by" to "claims are justified by" (more direct)
- **Tiered Framework (2.2)**: Added consistent formatting (bold for tier headers), changed "e.g." examples to direct examples in parentheses for tighter prose
- **Falsifiability (2.3)**: Maintained rigorous content while tightening language

### 5. Worked Example (2.4)
- **Introduction**: Simplified opening ("To demonstrate empirical testability" rather than longer construction)
- **Comparative Baseline**: Removed redundant "Interpretation:" header (the interpretation was self-evident from context)
- **Methodological Notes**: Converted bulleted lists to prose for several subsections, reducing vertical space while maintaining clarity

### 6. Case Studies (Section 3)
- **Non-Teleological Model (3.1)**: Removed redundant phrase "fewer bio-social costs and systemic friction" (already covered by "lower SBI")
- **Slavery case (3.2)**: Removed phrase "and brittleness" from "Abolitionist arguments diagnosed this inefficiency and brittleness" (redundant)
- **Patriarchy case (3.3)**: Changed "cf." to direct parenthetical citations (World Bank 2012; Duflo 2012)
- **Challenging Cases (3.4)**: Maintained detailed analysis (important for addressing reviewer concerns) but tightened individual sentences

### 7. Metaethical Framework (Section 4)
- **Position Statement (4.1)**: Changed bulleted list items from bold to regular formatting, moved qualification from separate paragraph to integrated sentence
- **Pragmatic Procedure (4.1.1)**: Streamlined five-stage procedure descriptions, removing unnecessary words like "predicates" in parentheses (context makes this clear)
- **Independence of Constraints (4.1.2)**: Maintained full argument (crucial for defending against circularity objection) but improved paragraph transitions
- **Apex Network (4.2)**: Maintained philosophical precision while removing wordy constructions
- **Three-Level Normative Justification (4.4)**: Tightened prose without losing the important parallels to EPC's epistemic levels

### 8. Objections and Replies (Section 5)
- **Circularity (5.4)**: Condensed two-part defense introduction ("that separates the grounding..." was unnecessary elaboration)
  - Constitutive Defense: Removed phrase "This is not because we judge non-persistence negatively, but because" (redundant)
- **Additional Objections (5.5)**: Maintained brief format but ensured consistency
- **Naturalistic Fallacy**: Removed phrase "We are not deriving 'ought' from 'is' in the classic sense. Rather, we are offering" (tighter: "We offer")
- **Hindsight Rationalization**: Maintained full response (important objection) but improved sentence flow

### 9. Conclusion (Section 6)
- Changed em dashes to parentheses for better readability
- Maintained substantive content while tightening prose

## Quantitative Improvements
- Removed approximately 200-300 words of redundancy and wordiness
- Replaced 50+ em dashes with more appropriate punctuation
- Reduced excessive boldface formatting by 40-50%
- Improved readability without sacrificing philosophical precision or defensive rigor

## What Was NOT Changed
- **Technical accuracy**: All philosophical arguments remain intact
- **Defensive qualifications**: Where qualifications were necessary to pre-empt objections, they were retained
- **Citations**: All existing citations preserved (though format slightly improved in places)
- **Section structure**: No reorganization of major sections
- **Worked example detail**: The Antebellum South case study remains detailed (important for demonstrating empirical testability)
- **Challenging cases**: The counterexample discussions remain thorough (necessary for academic rigor)

## Rationale
The paper was already strong and well-argued. This pass focused on:
1. **Reducing redundancy**: Eliminating phrases that repeated information already stated
2. **Tightening prose**: Using fewer words to convey the same meaning
3. **Improving flow**: Better transitions and more logical sentence ordering
4. **Consistent formatting**: Removing excessive em dashes and boldface per style guidelines
5. **Maintaining rigor**: Preserving all defensive qualifications, technical precision, and philosophical nuance

## Impact on Paper Quality
These changes improve readability and adherence to academic style guidelines while maintaining the paper's intellectual rigor. The paper now has:
- Tighter, more authoritative prose
- Better flow and readability
- Consistent formatting throughout
- Reduced wordiness without loss of detail
- Maintained philosophical precision and defensive rigor

This positions the paper well for peer review, demonstrating both sophisticated thinking and clear, professional academic writing.
