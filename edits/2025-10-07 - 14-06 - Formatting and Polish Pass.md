# Formatting and Polish Pass for proc_v7.md

**Date:** October 7, 2025, 14:06
**File:** proc_v7.md
**Type of Edit:** Comprehensive formatting consistency, redundancy removal, and publication polish

## Summary of Changes

This edit focused on ensuring the paper meets publication standards through systematic formatting improvements, consistency checks, and quality control.

## Specific Changes Made

### 1. Formatting Consistency (Major Focus)

**Removed Excessive Boldface:**
- Removed boldface from all subsection headings throughout the paper to maintain consistent academic style
- Changed bolded subsection titles (e.g., `**A. Measuring C(t): The Coercion Ratio**`) to regular text
- Changed bolded list items and structural elements to plain text
- Maintained boldface only where specifically needed for emphasis in running text

**Examples:**
- Section 2.2: Changed `**Tier 1: Bio-Social Costs.**` to `Tier 1: Bio-Social Costs.`
- Section 2.4: Changed `**A. Measuring C(t): The Coercion Ratio**` to `A. Measuring C(t): The Coercion Ratio`
- Section 3.4: Changed `**Case 1: Imperial China**` to `Case 1: Imperial China`
- Section 4.1.2: Changed `**Biological Constraints.**` to `Biological Constraints.`
- Section 4.6: Changed `**Core Similarities:**` to `Core Similarities:`
- Section 5.6: Changed `**The Viable Evil Possibility.**` to `The Viable Evil Possibility.`
- Section 5.7: Changed `**The Division of Labor Is Standard:**` to `The Division of Labor Is Standard:`

**Rationale:** Academic philosophy papers typically avoid excessive use of boldface. The overuse of boldface made the paper feel more like a blog post or manifesto rather than a scholarly work. This change brings it in line with standard journal formatting while maintaining readability through clear structure.

### 2. Removed Italicized Formatting in Subsections

**Changed italicized labels to plain text:**
- Section 2.4: `*Operational Definition*:` → `Operational Definition:`
- Section 2.4: `*Data Sources*:` → `Data Sources:`
- Section 2.4: `*Sample Calculation*:` → `Sample Calculation:`
- Section 2.4: `*Comparative Baseline*:` → `Comparative Baseline:`
- Section 2.4: `*Quantitative Analysis*:` → `Quantitative Analysis:`
- Section 3.4: `*The Challenge*:` → `The Challenge:`
- Section 3.4: `*Framework Response*:` → `Framework Response:`
- Section 3.4: `*Conclusion*:` → `Conclusion:`

**Rationale:** Consistent with removing excessive boldface, italicized labels create visual clutter and suggest a less formal style. Plain text labels are clearer and more professional.

### 3. Glossary Formatting

**Changed from bulleted list with boldface to definition list format:**
- Old: `*   **Apex Network**: The complete set...`
- New: `Apex Network: The complete set...` (with blank line between entries)

**Rationale:** The new format is cleaner and more consistent with standard glossary conventions in academic papers.

### 4. List Formatting in "General Lessons from Hard Cases"

**Removed boldface from enumerated list items:**
- Changed: `1. **Distinguish replicators from interactors**: ...`
- To: `1. Distinguish replicators from interactors: ...`

**Rationale:** Maintains consistency with the removal of excessive boldface throughout the document.

### 5. "Principled Limitations" Section Formatting

**Changed bulleted list to paragraph format:**
- Converted the four bullet points (Species-Specific, Floor Not Ceiling, Tragic Knowledge, Fallibilism) from bullets with hyphens to separate paragraphs

**Rationale:** More appropriate for the concluding summary of limitations; paragraph format integrates better with academic prose.

### 6. Citations

**Added Missing References:**
- Added: `Duflo, Esther. 2012. "Women Empowerment and Economic Development." *Journal of Economic Literature* 50(4): 1051–79.`
- Added: `World Bank. 2012. *World Development Report 2012: Gender Equality and Development*. Washington, DC: World Bank.`

**Rationale:** These citations were used in the text (Section 3.3 on patriarchy) but were missing from the references list. They are present in the master references.md file and needed to be included.

### 7. Consistency and Quality Control

**Verified:**
- All section cross-references are accurate (e.g., §5.4 reference checked)
- Citation formatting is consistent throughout
- No duplicate content or unnecessary repetition
- Terminology usage is consistent (e.g., "Standing Predicates," "Apex Network," "Negative Canon")
- No typos or grammatical errors found

## Rationale for Overall Approach

The paper's content and arguments are strong, but the formatting had some issues that would detract from its reception in peer review:

1. **Overuse of boldface** made the paper feel less scholarly and more like a blog post or popular article. Academic philosophy papers use boldface sparingly.

2. **Mixed formatting styles** (boldface + italics for labels, bullets vs. paragraphs) suggested inconsistent attention to presentation.

3. **Missing citations** could raise red flags in peer review.

These changes preserve all content while ensuring the paper presents professionally and meets standard academic formatting expectations.

## Impact on Content

**No substantive content changes were made.** All edits were purely formatting and organizational:
- No arguments were altered
- No evidence was removed or added
- No claims were strengthened or weakened
- The logical structure remains identical

## Publication Readiness

The paper is now formatted consistently according to academic philosophy standards and is ready for submission. The formatting changes:
- Remove visual clutter
- Improve professional appearance
- Ensure citation completeness
- Maintain clear hierarchical structure without excessive typographical emphasis
- Follow conventional academic style guidelines

## Technical Notes

- Total changes: ~50+ formatting corrections across the entire document
- All boldface section labels converted to plain text
- All italicized structural labels converted to plain text
- Two references added to bibliography
- Glossary reformatted
- Section 5.6 list reformatted to paragraphs

The paper now adheres to standard academic formatting while maintaining maximum clarity and readability.
