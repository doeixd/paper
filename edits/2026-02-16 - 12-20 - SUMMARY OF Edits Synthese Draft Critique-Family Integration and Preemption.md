## Scope

Integrated a new critique-family review into `real-patterns-need-closure-SYNTHESE.md` with selective adoption and misunderstanding pre-emption.

## What Was Implemented

1. Added methodological-modesty clarification in Section 1.2.
   - Clarifies the paper does not depend on the strongest anti-analytic readings of ETMG.
   - Frames closure as a constrained philosophical tool motivated by dynamical practice.

2. Added explicit Haugeland-facing clarification in Section 2.3.
   - States that objecthood is not inferred from pattern usefulness alone.
   - Reinforces transition-autonomy condition as ontological discriminator.

3. Added structural-triviality pre-emption in Section 2.10.
   - Clarifies criterion is modal/dynamical (counterfactual-interventional), not merely extensional structure.

4. Cleaned objection numbering in Section 5.
   - Renumbered subsections to a continuous sequence (5.1 to 5.8) after prior merges.

5. Updated references block in manuscript.
   - Added Haugeland (1998), now cited in Section 2.3.

## What Was Not Adopted

1. No broad expansion into ETMG meta-metaphysics disputes.
   - Reason: would risk scope drift for this manuscript's criterion-focused aim.

2. No heavy new citation block on Newman/Psillos/van Fraassen debate in main text.
   - Reason: addressed concern conceptually with a concise modal-versus-extensional clarification without reopening full OSR literature disputes.

## Rationale

This pass keeps the paper's scope tight while adding explicit signals that pre-empt predictable misunderstandings from both real-pattern and ETMG critics.
