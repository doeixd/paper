# Polish Refinements - November 12, 2025

## Summary

Applied three targeted polishing improvements to final.md identified from the comprehensive analysis report. All changes are minor phrasing and formatting refinements that preserve substantive content while improving clarity and readability.

## Changes Applied

### 1. Line 536: Removed Unexplained Superscript
**Location:** Section 7.2 "A Falsifiable Research Program"

**Before:**
```
Historical patterns in collapsed systems, such as Roman aqueduct failures due to accumulating brittleness in hydraulic engineering (Hodge 1992; Turchin 2003), are consistent with this expectation.² The specific metrics and dynamic equations underlying this research program are detailed in the Mathematical Appendix.
```

**After:**
```
Historical patterns in collapsed systems, such as Roman aqueduct failures due to accumulating brittleness in hydraulic engineering (Hodge 1992; Turchin 2003), are consistent with this expectation. The specific metrics and dynamic equations underlying this research program are detailed in the Mathematical Appendix.
```

**Rationale:** The superscript ² appeared with no corresponding footnote or explanation, creating visual noise. Removing it cleans up the text without loss of meaning.

### 2. Line 58: Reordered Phrase for Forward Momentum
**Location:** Section 2.1 "Grounding Knowledge in Observable Behavior: The Quinean Foundation"

**Before:**
```
Following Quine's call to naturalize epistemology (Quine 1969), we ground our analysis not in private mental states but in publicly observable patterns of linguistic behavior.
```

**After:**
```
Following Quine's call to naturalize epistemology (Quine 1969), we ground our analysis in publicly observable patterns of linguistic behavior rather than in private mental states.
```

**Rationale:** The revision moves from the negative (what we reject) to the positive (what we affirm), creating a more forward-looking and constructive rhetorical movement. The phrase "rather than" feels more decisive than the "not...but" construction.

---

### 3. Line 875: Active Voice - "Should Be Understood As" → "Function As"
**Location:** Final section before Appendix A

**Before:**
```
From this perspective, dissent, friction, and protest are not merely political problems but should be understood as primary sources of epistemological data.
```

**After:**
```
From this perspective, dissent, friction, and protest are not merely political problems but function as primary sources of epistemological data.
```

**Rationale:** "Function as" is more direct and active than "should be understood as," which carries a softer, more interpretative tone. In a framework grounded in pragmatic viability, "function as" better captures the operational reality that dissent and friction serve as diagnostic signals regardless of how one conceptualizes them.

## Checked But No Changes Needed

### References Section
- **Bennett-Hunter entries (1074, 1076):** These are two distinct works by the same author:
  - Line 1074: "Emergence, Emergentism and Pragmatism" (journal article)
  - Line 1076: "Ineffability and Religious Experience" (monograph)
  - Both are correctly cited and should be retained.

- **Rottschaefer entries (1202, 1204):** These are two distinct works:
  - Line 1202: Handbook chapter on "Moral Realism and Evolutionary Moral Psychology"
  - Line 1204: Journal article on "The Moral Realism of Pragmatic Naturalism"
  - Both are correctly cited and should be retained.

### Line 644: Section Title
- "### 5.4 The General Principle: Mathematics as Pure Pragmatic Selection"
- Assessment: Clear, punchy, and effective. No change needed.

### Line 295
- No "is built from" phrase found in current text. This suggestion likely referred to an earlier version that has since been revised.

## Overall Assessment

These three changes represent focused, high-impact polishing:
- Removes visual noise (superscript)
- Improves rhetorical flow (phrase reordering)
- Strengthens semantic precision (active voice)

All changes preserve the paper's argumentative structure and philosophical content while enhancing readability. The paper maintains its authoritative academic tone while becoming slightly more direct and clear.
