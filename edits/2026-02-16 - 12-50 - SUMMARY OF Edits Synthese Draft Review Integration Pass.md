# Summary: Review Integration Pass on Synthese Draft

**Date:** 2026-02-16
**File:** `real-patterns-need-closure-SYNTHESE.md`

## Source

External review feedback identifying four targeted improvements plus a comparison audit against the older `real-patterns-as-closure.md` draft.

## Changes Made

### From Review Feedback

1. **Anti-bespoke-encoding sentence (§2.8).** Added explicit requirement that candidate partitions must be specified independently of the sample trajectory used to score closure. Blocks the "trivial closure by redefining macrostates" move that a referee could press. Placed directly after the canonical criterion statement.

2. **Minimum viability floor formulation (§4.2).** Added a crisp, non-numeric definition: a partition fails minimum viability if within-class micro-features yield consistent, non-negligible gains across declared robustness checks. Preserves the anti-threshold stance while giving the floor a criterion-shaped statement.

3. **Standing commitments paragraph (§5 opening).** Added a three-point standing commitments paragraph at the start of the objections section: (a) does not deny microphysical completeness, (b) all verdicts are indexed, (c) strongest conclusion is conditional. This reduces repeated cadences at the end of individual objection replies and saves word count.

4. **Haugeland critique tradition (§1).** Added 2 sentences in the introduction tying the permissiveness worry to Haugeland's established critique line and the "cheap coding" objection tradition. Satisfies the reviewer's expectation that the paper engage with known Dennett-critical literature early.

### Trimmed in §5.2

Removed ~3 paragraphs of redundant restatement in the causal exclusion reply (§5.2) that repeated points now covered by the standing commitments paragraph. Kept the substantive target-indexing argument and Kim citations.

### From Comparison Audit (Old Draft vs. Synthese)

5. **Dennett's direct quote (§1).** Added the canonical Dennett formulation ("A pattern exists in some data—is real—if there is a description of the data that is more efficient than the bit map") to the introduction. Anchors the dialectical target precisely. Standard practice for a paper that positions against Dennett's criterion.

6. **ε-machine / υ-machine explanation (§3).** Expanded the one-sentence computational mechanics reference into a clear 3-sentence explanation of the two prediction machines and what their equivalence means for closure. Since Rosas is a key interlocutor and the paper borrows this machinery, a referee familiar with computational mechanics would expect adequate engagement.

## Rationale

All changes target peer-review resilience. The review feedback items block the most likely "this is still too discretionary" referee report. The comparison audit items prevent "insufficient engagement with key interlocutors" notes. No scope expansion; total additions are approximately 200 words, offset by the §5.2 trimming.
