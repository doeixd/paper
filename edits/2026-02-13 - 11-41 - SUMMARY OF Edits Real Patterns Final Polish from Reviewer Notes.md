# Summary of Edits

## Scope

Applied a final polish pass to `real-patterns-as-closure.md` based on reviewer notes about intervention-class grounding, regime dependence, and presentation accessibility.

## Key Revisions

1. Updated abstract phrasing from first-person progression to manuscript-neutral form ("This paper then extends...").
2. Strengthened admissible intervention-class defense in the introduction by explicitly anchoring admissibility in physical constraints (local propagation and energetic feasibility).
3. Added the same physical-admissibility anchor to the intervention scope note in Section 3.1.
4. Clarified the predictive/interventional hierarchy language and retained interventional closure as the ontological standard.
5. Improved toy-example readability by explicitly stating the $\alpha \neq \gamma$ consequence for predicting movement from $B_1$.
6. Expanded regime-dependent ontology section to explicitly frame objecthood as phase-dependent, with causal structure appearing/disappearing across regime transitions.
7. Clarified "elbow criterion" in plain language as a point of diminishing returns.
8. Replaced pseudo-code block with a philosophy-journal-friendly presentation:
   - labeled as "Algorithm 1: Protocol for leakiness estimation,"
   - defined $g_k$ and $\Delta_k$ in prose,
   - converted to numbered procedural steps.
9. Reinforced Section 9.1 by adding a one-line anti-instrumentalism anchor: admissible intervention classes are bounded by locality and energetic feasibility.

## Rationale

- These edits preserve the paper's core argument while reducing avoidable reviewer friction over style and methodological framing.
- The manuscript now better signals that intervention classes are world-constrained rather than preference-driven.

## Style and Standards

- No em dashes introduced.
- No pseudo-quantification introduced.
- Mathematical notation preserved in LaTeX delimiters.
