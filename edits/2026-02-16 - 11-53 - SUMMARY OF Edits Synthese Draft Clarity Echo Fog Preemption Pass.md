## Scope

Performed a targeted clarity, anti-echo, and pre-emption pass on `real-patterns-need-closure-SYNTHESE.md`.

## Main Improvements

1. Reduced local repetition and tightened wording in Section 2.
   - Simplified phrasing in 2.6 and reduced redundant emphasis.
   - Sharpened 2.12 so it summarizes criterion/evaluation/commitment without repeating prior formulations.

2. Improved readability in Section 4.
   - Tightened dense sentences in 4.8.
   - Clarified sequence language in 4.11 and fixed grammatical roughness.
   - Streamlined 4.12 by reducing duplicate phrasing and making the convergence rule more explicit.

3. Strengthened pre-emption in Section 5.
   - Added explicit note in 5.2 that hard admissibility cases are marked unresolved rather than settled by stipulation.
   - Added a narrower fallback sentence in 5.3 for readers who reject the full target-indexing move.
   - Tightened phrasing in 5.8 to reduce density while preserving content.

## Rationale

The pass keeps all substantive commitments intact while improving legibility for skeptical readers and reducing opportunities for avoidable misreadings from different philosophical priors.
