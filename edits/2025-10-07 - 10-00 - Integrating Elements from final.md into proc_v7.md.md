## Overview
This session integrated key elements from final.md into proc_v7.md to strengthen coherence across the EPC project. Changes focused on importing the entrenchment mechanism, deploying evocative metaphors, and clarifying scope with references to the foundational epistemology paper.

## Specific Changes Made

### 1. Integrate Mechanism of Entrenchment (New Subsection 4.5)
**Added "The Entrenchment of Moral Principles: From Hypothesis to Core Norm":**
"How does a normative principle like `innocent people should not be punished` achieve its foundational status? The process is explained by the entrenchment mechanism detailed in EPC. It is a journey of earning pragmatic indispensability:

1. **Peripheral Hypothesis:** The principle begins as a contested proposal, a potential solution to the high costs of rival principles like collective punishment.
2. **Migration Inward:** As it demonstrates its immense value in lowering systemic brittleness—reducing C(t) by increasing legitimacy and stability—its revision becomes prohibitively costly. It becomes a **Standing Predicate** used to vet new laws and policies.
3. **Core Principle (Systemic Caching):** Finally, its indispensability becomes so profound that it is embedded in the very infrastructure of a viable legal system (constitutions, legal training, judicial review). This **systemic caching** is a rational response to **bounded rationality**; the system entrenches its most successful discoveries to avoid the crippling cost of re-deriving them for every new case.

A core moral principle is therefore not a self-evident axiom. It is a piece of highly optimized social technology that has survived the most rigorous pragmatic stress-testing imaginable. Its justification *is* its proven, indispensable functional role in our most viable social architectures."

**Rationale:** Directly imports the entrenchment mechanism from final.md's Section 5, applying it to moral principles to explain how they become "core."

### 2. Use "Architecture of Failure" Metaphor (Conclusion)
**Added to conclusion:** "It is a philosophy that learns from the **architecture of failure** to engineer more viable architectures of cooperation."
**Rationale:** Echoes final.md's title metaphor to create a consistent brand and reinforce the methodological insight.

### 3. Clarify Scope with References to final.md
**Added in Section 2.5:** "The detailed methodology for conducting such a historical analysis, including protocols for operationalizing the brittleness metrics with inter-rater reliability checks, is laid out in the foundational paper for this framework (Glenn, Forthcoming)."
**Added in Section 4.4:** "This multi-level account of normative justification is a direct application of the general three-level framework for truth developed in EPC (see Glenn, Forthcoming, Section 4.3)."
**Rationale:** Explicitly references final.md to manage scope, showing the foundational work is done elsewhere and this paper applies it to metaethics.

## Overall Assessment
These integrations unify the EPC project, making proc_v7.md a seamless extension of final.md. They enhance explanatory power by importing proven mechanisms and metaphors, while projecting confidence through clear scope management.
