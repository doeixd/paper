# Summary of Edits

## Scope

Applied a focused hardening pass to `real-patterns-as-closure.md` in response to top-venue peer-review concerns about formal precision, interventionist grounding, and overclaim risk.

## Major Revisions

1. Reframed title and abstract language toward "dynamically coherent" objecthood to avoid overpromising a blanket ban on all intuitive disjunctions.
2. Added a formal note under the Markov lemma specifying strong lumpability in explicit symbolic form and clarifying what "transition-autonomous" means.
3. Added a controlled-process caveat: interventions can alter closure unless treated as part of a fixed controlled transition policy class.
4. Defined "macro-transition profile" explicitly in notation section to reduce informal ambiguity.
5. Expanded the normative bridge (`3.5`) with a mini interventional discriminant example (equal observational fit, divergent interventional stability).
6. Added a compact schematic table in `5.3` that concretely instantiates process, partitions, intervention class, horizons, diagnostics, and expected verdict.
7. Reframed Section 7 from "passes" language to "plausible candidates under the protocol" and softened claims to hypothesis-level phrasing.
8. Updated roadmap and conclusion to align with evaluation framing rather than unconditional empirical claims.

## Rationale

- These edits directly target likely reviewer objections that the manuscript is either technically under-specified or rhetorically over-strong.
- The paper now more clearly distinguishes exact formal claims, operational protocol claims, and illustrative domain claims.
- The interventionist bridge now has a clearer discriminative consequence instead of reading as stipulation.

## Style and Standards

- No em dashes introduced.
- No pseudo-quantification introduced.
- Formal notation remains in LaTeX delimiters.
- Philosophical tone remains measured and non-grandiose while improving technical specificity.
