## What changed

- Added a framing paragraph in the introduction that explicitly presents the paper as a refinement of Dennett's real-pattern view, not a rejection.
- Added clarifying language in Section 3.5 to separate two claims: broad pattern reality versus stricter macro-objecthood.
- Added a graded ontological interpretation in Section 5.2 linking leakiness levels to strength of objecthood claims.
- Expanded Section 8.1 to acknowledge that useful but imperfect patterns can still warrant realist treatment.
- Added a direct reconciliation statement in Section 8.2: Dennett provides a broad realism criterion, while this paper adds a stricter closure-based filter for robust macro-objects.

## Why these edits were made

These revisions address a recurring interpretive risk: readers may infer that closure criteria deny realism to all leaky or noisy higher-level patterns. The new language removes that ambiguity. It preserves the paper's stronger claim about robust macro-objecthood while preventing a false dilemma between strict closure and any realist treatment of imperfect patterns.

## Reviewer-resilience rationale

- **Charity and continuity**: The argument now signals continuity with Dennett before introducing disagreement about standards.
- **Scope control**: The ontology claim is restricted to macro-objecthood, reducing overreach.
- **Objection pre-emption**: The text now explicitly blocks the objection that the framework is covert eliminativism about ordinary scientific practice.
- **Conceptual precision**: Leakiness is tied to graded status rather than binary inclusion/exclusion, which better matches the framework's own commitments.

## Style and policy checks applied

- Preserved plain, measured academic tone.
- Avoided pseudo-quantification and avoided introducing new unnecessary named concepts.
- Kept examples and claims explanatory rather than empirical-proof oriented.
- Maintained no-em-dash and no-footnote constraints.
