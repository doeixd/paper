# Summary of Completing Reference Database and Citation Matching

## Date and Time
2025-10-07 09:00

## Overview
Completed the reference database by ensuring all citations in final.md are properly matched to entries in references.md and grok_ref.md. This involved updating the citation extractor script to handle hyphenated names and multi-author citations, and adjusting one citation in the paper for consistency.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Citation Extractor Script (`citation_extractor.py`)
- **Enhanced in-prose citation pattern**: Modified regex to detect hyphenated author names (e.g., "Bennett-Hunter") by adding `(?:-[A-Z][a-z]+)?` to the author matching group.
- **Improved matching logic**: Added handling for multi-author citations using "and" or "&" by attempting to match on primary author when full author string fails.
- **Fixed code structure**: Corrected misplaced code blocks and properly defined the `match_citation_to_reference` function.

### 2. Adjusted Citation in Paper (`final.md`)
- **Line 513**: Changed "(Ladyman & Ross 2007)" to "(Ladyman and Ross 2007)" for consistency with reference formatting.

### 3. References Added (Previously Completed)
- Confirmed all required references are present:
  - Acemoglu, Daron, and James A. Robinson. 2012. *Why Nations Fail: The Origins of Power, Prosperity, and Poverty*.
  - Baggio, Guido, and Andrea Parravicini. 2019. "Introduction to Pragmatism and Theories of Emergence."
  - Bennett-Hunter, Guy. 2015. "Emergence, Emergentism and Pragmatism."
  - Ladyman, James, and Don Ross. 2007. *Every Thing Must Go: Metaphysics Naturalized*.
  - Russell, Bertrand. 1903. *The Principles of Mathematics*.
- All references include proper Chicago-style formatting and ISBN/DOI where available.

### 4. Summary Files Updated (`grok_ref.md`)
- Confirmed 2-sentence summaries are present for all added references.

## Verification
- Ran citation extractor on final.md: All 41 citations now properly matched (0 NOT FOUND).
- Generated final PDF successfully with 32 filtered references.
- No missing citations reported in the release pipeline.

## Impact
- Ensures academic integrity by providing complete, properly formatted references for all citations.
- Improves citation matching robustness for future use.
- Final paper is now ready for submission with fully verified references.
