## Scope

Continued development pass on `real-patterns-need-closure-SYNTHESE.md` to improve philosophical precision, objection handling, and plan alignment.

## What Was Added or Revised

1. Added an explicit distinction section:
   - New Section 2.6 clarifies pattern reality versus macro-objecthood.
   - Prevents reviewer confusion between weak pattern usefulness and strong ontological commitment.

2. Added explicit failure and downgrade rules:
   - New Section 4.6 states conditions under which commitments should be downgraded.
   - Reinforces disciplined non-binary verdict structure in non-ideal settings.

3. Added a targeted objection on special-sciences autonomy:
   - New Section 5.4 addresses the concern that the view is merely a relabeling of autonomy claims.
   - Clarifies distinctive contribution: discriminating closure condition with exclusion/downgrade rules.

4. Renumbered and retained existing objections:
   - Markov and formalism objections now follow the added autonomy objection.

5. Strengthened conclusion framing:
   - Added compact restatement of the central philosophical move (underconstrained realism -> closure constraint -> exact/non-ideal implementation).

## Rationale

This pass targets likely Synthese reviewer pressure points while preserving scope discipline. The edits improve conceptual clarity, reduce equivocation risk, and better demonstrate the draft's distinct philosophical contribution.
