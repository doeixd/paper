# Summary of Edits

## Scope

Integrated high-value conceptual and argumentative elements from `The Reality of Wholes.md` into `real-patterns-as-closure.md` to strengthen reviewer resilience without changing the paper's core thesis.

## What Was Added

1. Added explicit $\varepsilon$/$\upsilon$ closure language in Section 3.2 to connect the paper's criterion to computational-mechanics framing already used in the wider project.
2. Added an explicit diagnostic-vs-constitutive clarification: prediction and intervention are evidential tests of pre-existing dependency structure, not ontology-generating acts.
3. Added type-vs-token robustness qualification in Section 5.1 to prevent token-failure objections from undermining type-level closure claims.
4. Strengthened Section 5.5 with a prediction-only caution: in-sample fit is insufficient; closure requires out-of-regime and interventional stability.
5. Strengthened anti-instrumentalism response in Section 9.1 with constraint-relative wording: domain choice can vary, closure facts cannot once regime is fixed.

## Rationale

- These additions directly address likely top-venue objections about instrumentalism, overfitting, and scope of closure claims.
- The integrated points preserve continuity with the existing EPC/Wholes framework while keeping this paper focused and concise.

## Style and Standards

- No em dashes introduced.
- No pseudo-quantification introduced.
- Mathematical variables remain in LaTeX delimiters.
