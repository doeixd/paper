## Scope

Continued expansion pass on `real-patterns-need-closure-SYNTHESE.md` focused on argumentative structure and evidential clarity.

## What Was Added

1. New Section 1.4 (Contribution Map).
   - Added a concise three-part contribution statement.
   - Clarified the central payoff as selective commitment.

2. New Section 2.9 (Predictive and Interventional Closure).
   - Clarified distinction and asymmetry between predictive and interventional closure.
   - Specified burden of proof for robust versus qualified verdicts.

3. New Section 4.11 (Reporting Discipline).
   - Added a five-item reporting template for closure assessments.
   - Reinforced transparency around partition, regime, horizon, admissibility, diagnostics, and verdict type.

4. New objection Section 5.12 (Criterion conservatism concern).
   - Addressed worry that closure standards might be too conservative.
   - Clarified developmental/qualified commitment logic for emerging macro-patterns.

## Rationale

These additions strengthen Synthese-facing readability by making the paper's contribution map clearer and by tightening the link between philosophical criterion and disciplined evidential reporting without expanding scope into a methods-heavy treatment.
