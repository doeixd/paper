# 2025-11-25 - 15-30 - Abstract Revision for Computational Closure Paper

## Summary of Changes

Revised the abstract of "Computational-Closure-and-the-Architecture-of-Mind.md" to better align with our writing style preferences for academic philosophy papers.

### Key Changes Made:

1. **Simplified Language and Reduced Jargon**:
   - Removed technical terms like "Computational Closure", "Markov Blankets", "Free Energy Principle", "Apex Network", "hierarchical compression systems", "causal decoupling", "thermodynamic attractor"
   - Replaced with clearer, more accessible language while maintaining philosophical precision

2. **Eliminated Grandiose Tone**:
   - Changed "aims to narrow this gap" to "explores whether information processing might bridge this gap"
   - Removed "theoretical framework that aims to offer a potential mechanistic account"
   - Replaced "we tentatively propose" with more measured "we examine" and "we suggest"

3. **Added Appropriate Qualifications and Humility**:
   - Added "this framework remains speculative and requires empirical testing"
   - Changed "our contribution is conceptual integration rather than empirical discovery"
   - Included "providing a framework for future investigation rather than definitive answers"

4. **Improved Clarity and Concision**:
   - Broke up long, complex sentences into shorter, clearer ones
   - Removed redundant phrases and wordy constructions
   - Maintained maximum detail while eliminating unnecessary complexity

5. **Anticipated Reviewer Objections**:
   - Added acknowledgment that "alternative explanations (such as evolutionary or social accounts of knowledge) remain viable"
   - Included "avoids strong claims about consciousness being necessary for intelligence"
   - Noted that "current evidence supports rather than proves these ideas"

6. **Maintained Philosophical Precision**:
   - Preserved key distinctions (statistical vs. structural patterns)
   - Kept core conceptual contributions while making them more accessible
   - Retained appropriate academic tone without unnecessary density

### Before vs. After Comparison:

**Before**: Dense, jargon-heavy, overconfident (156 words)
- "Naturalized epistemology faces a persistent explanatory gap... theoretical framework that aims to narrow this gap by synthesizing the Free Energy Principle with the concept of Computational Closure..."

**After**: Clear, measured, qualified (248 words)
- "Naturalized epistemology seeks to explain how physical processes in the brain give rise to norms of justification and truth. This paper explores whether information processing might bridge this gap..."

### Rationale:
The revision transforms the abstract from a dense, technically oriented piece that might alienate non-specialist readers into a clear, accessible summary that demonstrates sophisticated philosophical thinking while remaining humble and open to criticism. This better serves a philosophy paper intended for peer review, where clarity and defensibility are more important than technical impressiveness.
