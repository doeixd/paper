# Summary of Edits: Implementation of Comprehensive Revision Suggestions

## Overview
Implemented all suggestions from the peer review feedback to sharpen framing, enhance scholarly engagement, and polish structural/stylistic elements of final.md.

## Detailed Changes

### 1. Sharpening the Framing and Key Distinctions
- **Rebranded P(t) Indicator:** Changed "Patch Velocity" to "Conceptual Debt Accumulation" throughout the paper, including table in Section 2.3 and all references in Sections 3.2, 3.5, 5.2.1.
- **Added Subsection 7.0:** New "From Systemic Health to Individual Justification" in Section 7, providing Bayesian framework for individual epistemic trust allocation based on network brittleness.
- **Centralized Reef Chart Metaphor:** Added to Introduction ("This 'reef chart' epistemology is the central theme of our framework."), Section 4.1 ("The first step in constructing our reef chart is to systematically catalogue the shipwrecks."), and Conclusion (replaced final paragraph with focus on reef chart navigation).

### 2. Enhancing Scholarly Engagement
- **Ontic Structural Realism:** Added paragraph in Section 6.1.1 explaining how framework naturalizes OSR claims via pragmatic filtering and convergence to Apex Network.
- **Social Epistemology:** Expanded Section 6.2 to naturalize standpoint theory within brittleness framework, emphasizing marginalized perspectives as detectors of hidden costs.

### 3. Structural and Stylistic Polishing
- **Eliminated Redundant Footnote:** Removed duplicate footnote ยน in Introduction.
- **Restructured Section 3:** 
  - Renamed 3.2 to "The Solution: A Tiered Diagnostic Framework"
  - Merged content from old 3.2 and 3.5 into new 3.2
  - Renamed 3.3 to "The Method: Triangulation and Operational Protocols"
  - Merged content from old 3.3 and 3.4 into new 3.3
  - Deleted old 3.4 and 3.5
- **Streamlined Section 5.2:**
  - Consolidated into three subsections: 5.2.1 (indicators + examples), 5.2.2 (case study), 5.2.3 (power/suppression + general principle)
  - Moved examples from old 5.2.4 to 5.2.1
  - Merged content from old 5.2.3, 5.2.5, 5.2.6 into new 5.2.3
  - Deleted old 5.2.4, 5.2.5, 5.2.6

## Deleted Information
- Duplicate footnote in Introduction
- Old Section 3.4: "Protocol in Action: An Operational Test for Coercive Overheads" (content merged into 3.3)
- Old Section 3.5: "A Tiered Diagnostic Framework for Cost-Shifting" (content merged into 3.2)
- Old Section 5.2.4: "Mathematical Progress as Brittleness Reduction" (examples moved to 5.2.1)
- Old Section 5.2.5: "Power and Suppression in Mathematics" (content merged into 5.2.3)
- Old Section 5.2.6: "The General Principle" (content merged into 5.2.3)
- Duplicate case study header in 5.2

## Rationale
These changes enhance clarity, coherence, and scholarly depth while maintaining the paper's core arguments and qualifications. The reef chart metaphor now unifies the narrative, brittleness rebranding improves conceptual precision, and structural consolidations eliminate redundancy for better flow.
