**Editor**: Patrick

## Changes Made

### 1. Sharpened ε-machine Equivalence Conditions (Part 5)

**Location**: Lines 176-177

**Problem**: The original formulation stated that computational closure occurs "when both [ε-machine and υ-machine] predict equally well," but this was formally loose. It left three critical parameters unspecified:
- Over what timescale does the prediction hold?
- With what error tolerance?
- Under which class of interventions?

**Solution**: Added explicit parameterization referencing Rosas et al. (2024), specifying that closure depends on:
1. **Prediction timescale**: How far ahead you're predicting (e.g., cell membrane achieves closure over seconds, not hours)
2. **Error tolerance**: Acceptable discrepancy (e.g., hurricane landfall within 50 km vs. 10 km)
3. **Intervention class**: Which perturbations are considered (e.g., membrane screens off chemical diffusion but not gamma radiation)

**Rationale**: This precision shuts down objections that closure is observer-relative or subjective. While closure is task-relative, once the prediction task is specified, whether the system achieves closure is fully objective and measurable. This strengthens the paper's defense against charges of arbitrariness while maintaining accessibility by gesturing to the framework rather than providing heavy formalism.

**Key Addition**:
> "Closure is not absolute but task-relative. However, once the prediction task is specified, whether the macro-variables achieve closure is fully objective and measurable, independent of the investigator's preferences."

### 2. Explicit Weak Functionalism Commitment (Part 7)

**Location**: Lines 275-276

**Problem**: The consciousness section brought in examples of triangles, dragons, and the China Brain thought experiment, which implicitly rely on functionalist assumptions about mental content. This opened a potential line of attack: critics could claim we're "smuggling in functionalism" without acknowledging it.

**Solution**: Added an explicit commitment to weak functionalism about mental content early in the section, before the potentially controversial examples. The commitment is clear and direct:

> "However, we must acknowledge what this commits us to: this framework entails at least a weak functionalism about mental content. That is, we are committed to the view that what makes a mental state the state it is depends on its functional role (its causal-computational relations to inputs, outputs, and other states), not solely on its physical substrate."

**Rationale**: Transparency beats hedging. Rather than leaving readers to infer our commitments, we state them directly. This:
- Pre-empts the "smuggling" objection
- Shows philosophical honesty and rigor
- Allows readers who reject functionalism to understand exactly where they diverge from our framework
- Strengthens the overall argument by making assumptions explicit

The commitment is qualified as "weak functionalism" to avoid unnecessary baggage from stronger functionalist claims about consciousness or qualia.

## Strategic Defensive Improvements

Both changes follow the same defensive strategy:

1. **Identify potential attack vectors** (vague closure conditions, implicit functionalism)
2. **Make commitments explicit** rather than leaving them implicit
3. **Precision over vagueness** while maintaining readability
4. **Acknowledge limitations** where appropriate (task-relativity of closure)

These edits make the paper more resilient to philosophical criticism without adding unnecessary complexity or jargon. They demonstrate mastery of the relevant literature (Rosas et al.) while maintaining the paper's accessible, clear writing style.

## Impact on Core Argument

Neither change weakens the core argument. Instead, they:
- **Strengthen** the ε-machine framework by making its conditions explicit and measurable
- **Clarify** the philosophical commitments about mental content
- **Reduce** surface area for criticism by addressing objections proactively
- **Maintain** the paper's balance between rigor and accessibility

The paper now has tighter formal conditions and more transparent philosophical commitments, both of which enhance its credibility for peer review.
