# Summary of Edits

## Scope

Implemented a targeted revision pass on `real-patterns-as-closure.md` to address Reviewer #2's major concerns about formal precision, interventionist grounding, operational actionability, and rhetoric.

## Major Revisions

1. Updated abstract language to foreground dynamic coherence and explicitly include the "weird but closed" concession.
2. Strengthened formal section around the Markov lemma by adding:
   - explicit strong lumpability condition,
   - explicit meaning of transition autonomy,
   - a scope note distinguishing uncontrolled Markov and controlled/interventional cases using policy class $\Pi$.
3. Moved predictive-versus-interventional closure distinction earlier (Section 3) and clarified that interventional closure is primary for objecthood.
4. Strengthened the closure-to-objecthood bridge in `3.5` by making the difference-maker claim explicit: interventional divergence grounds ontological preference, not just model convenience.
5. Added a concrete decision schema for "low leakiness" in `5.2` with benchmark family, standardized proxy, tolerance rule, and stability checks.
6. Made the worked regime instantiation more actionable by adding a minimal implementation sketch (pseudo-code workflow).
7. Added explicit bridge sentence linking stable-vs-entailed distinction to why gerrymandered regularities can be entailed yet unstable/high-maintenance.
8. Added a ladder reminder at the start of Section 6 to prevent representation-failure conflation in pathology discussion.

## Rationale

- These edits reduce likely top-venue objections that the method is suggestive but not executable.
- The manuscript now cleanly separates exact formal claims from controlled/interventional scope claims.
- The revised structure better supports the normative bridge from closure diagnostics to objecthood claims.

## Style and Standards

- No em dashes introduced.
- No pseudo-quantified historical or hypothetical claims introduced.
- Mathematical notation remains in LaTeX delimiters.
