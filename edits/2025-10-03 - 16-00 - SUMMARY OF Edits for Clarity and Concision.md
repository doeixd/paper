**Summary**: This round of edits focuses on five key areas: abstract condensation, qualification of speculative elements (e.g., formulas), redundancy reduction, pre-emption of misunderstandings in ontology, and conclusion tightening. Total word count reduced by ~15% in targeted sections without losing detail.

**Explanation**: Edits prioritize academic humility by adding qualifications (e.g., "speculative," "heuristic") to avoid overconfidence, while enhancing clarity through simpler structure and plain language. They anticipate reviewer criticisms like circularity or over-mathematization by addressing them inline. Logical flow improves by holding the reader's hand (e.g., explicit purpose statements). Changes maintain the paper's sophisticated thinking, ensuring claims are strong but evidence-based, with no loss of qualifications or citations. This prepares the paper better for peer review by making it more accessible and defensible.
