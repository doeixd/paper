# Summary of Edits

## Scope

Implemented a focused revision pass on `real-patterns-as-closure.md` to address major accept/reject-level concerns about operationalization, criterion strength, normative bridge, and technical scope.

## Major Revisions

1. Added a stronger normative bridge section (`3.5 Why closure, not prediction alone`) that contrasts:
   - compression-prediction realism,
   - pure pragmatism,
   - closure under fixed horizon and intervention class,
   and includes a concrete difference-maker claim (same compression, different interventional stability).
2. Added an explicit worked regime instantiation (`5.3`) with:
   - candidate coarse-grainings,
   - fixed intervention class $\mathcal{I}$,
   - horizon comparison ($L=1$ vs $L=10$),
   - horizon-relative closure verdict.
3. Clarified empirical status of domain examples by explicitly framing hurricanes/organisms as stylized protocol illustrations, not stand-alone empirical demonstrations.
4. Added explicit distinction between predictive closure and interventional closure (`5.5`) and stated which is primary for objecthood claims in this paper.
5. Refined gerrymandering rhetoric:
   - non-gerrymandered now explicitly means dynamically coherent under closure tests,
   - clarified that weird/disjunctive partitions can count as real if genuinely closed in the specified regime.
6. Clarified leakiness data mode in `5.2`: observational, interventional, or mixed estimation depending on admissible interventions.

## Rationale

- These changes directly pre-empt likely top-venue referee objections that the criterion is either under-specified or rhetorically over-strong.
- The paper now presents closure as a testable regime-relative standard with explicit decision procedure and failure profile.
- The revisions increase discriminative force without overextending technical claims.

## Style and Standards

- No em dashes introduced.
- No pseudo-quantification introduced.
- Mathematical notation remains in LaTeX delimiters.
- Added material remains philosophy-forward while preserving formal precision.
