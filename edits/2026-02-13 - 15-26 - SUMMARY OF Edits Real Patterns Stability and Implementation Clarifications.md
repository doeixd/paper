## What changed

- Strengthened the type-token framing in Section 2.1 by stating explicitly that closure is primarily a type-level regime claim, then secondarily about token instantiation reliability.
- Fortified Section 5.1 against token-level counterexamples by adding a clear criterion for when anomalous tokens matter for ontology.
- Reworked Section 5.4 into an explicit entailed-pattern versus stable-pattern distinction, with a direct Laplacean clarification: objecthood tracks privileged stable compressions, not every entailed truth of a trajectory.
- Replaced the defensive wording in Section 9.4 with a positive account of mathematics as constrained by invariants of intelligibility, while preserving the formal-versus-empirical distinction.
- Updated the conclusion's social-kinds paragraph to distinguish structure, implementation, and representation, and to explain why implementation failure can dissolve closure even when rules persist.

## Why these edits were made

These revisions target likely reviewer pressure points about permissiveness, observer-idealization, and abstract-object scope. The core aim was to make the ontology criterion more precise without expanding the paper beyond its current commitments.

## Resilience rationale

- Preserves the paper's main thesis while reducing avoidable ambiguity.
- Avoids overclaiming by keeping formal coherence distinct from empirical objecthood.
- Clarifies that denying macro-objecthood for gerrymandered cases is not a claim of falsehood but of instability.
- Maintains the project's style constraints and concise argumentative flow.
