## Summary of Changes

Added the Sterelny (2012) citation to proc_v7.md in the evolutionary debunking objection section.

## Specific Edits Made

### 1. Added Sterelny Citation in proc_v7.md (Line 357)
**Before:**
```
**Objection: Evolutionary Debunking** - Evolutionary pressures shaped moral intuitions for survival, not truth (Street 2006). **Reply:** EPC resolves Street's dilemma by collapsing one of its horns.
```

**After:**
```
**Objection: Evolutionary Debunking** - Evolutionary pressures shaped moral intuitions for survival, not truth (Street 2006; Sterelny 2012). **Reply:** EPC resolves Street's dilemma by collapsing one of its horns.
```

**Rationale:** Sterelny (2012) "Morality's Dark Past" is directly relevant to evolutionary accounts of morality and addresses similar themes to Street's evolutionary debunking argument. The paper discusses the evolutionary origins of morality and provides additional support for the discussion of evolutionary pressures on moral intuitions.

## Verification
- Confirmed Sterelny (2012) reference exists in references.md
- Verified the DOI is valid and the paper exists
- Citation properly formatted as multi-author citation alongside Street (2006)

## Impact
- Strengthens the philosophical discussion of evolutionary debunking arguments
- Provides additional scholarly support for the framework's response to evolutionary challenges
- Maintains consistency with existing citation practices in the paper
