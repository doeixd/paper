## Summaries of Each Item

### 1. Friston (2012): "A Free Energy Principle for the Brain"

This paper presents the **Free Energy Principle (FEP)** as a **unified theory for brain function**, proposing that all sentient systems must minimize a quantity called **variational free energy** to maintain their existence and resist the natural tendency to disorder (entropy). The free energy is an upper bound on the "surprise" or negative log-evidence of sensory data, meaning that by minimizing free energy, the brain implicitly maximizes the evidence for its internal model of the world. This minimization process is argued to explain perception (by updating beliefs to reduce prediction error) and action (by selecting movements that change sensory input to match predictions). The FEP thus provides a single, overarching imperative that unifies perception, action, and learning within a single mathematical framework.

### 2. Friston (2010): "The Free-Energy Principle: A Unified Brain Theory?"

This article offers a comprehensive overview of the FEP, arguing for its potential as a **unified brain theory**. It posits that the brain is an **inference machine** that constantly tries to predict its sensory inputs. The FEP provides the mathematical foundation for this idea, suggesting that the brain's structure and function are optimized to minimize prediction error. The paper discusses how the FEP relates to various neuroscientific concepts, including **predictive coding**, **Bayesian inference**, and **attentional mechanisms**, which are framed as modulating the precision (or inverse variance) of prediction errors. The core argument is that the FEP can account for the functional anatomy and dynamics of the brain, from single neurons to large-scale networks, under a single principle of self-organization.

### 3. Friston and Kiebel (2009): "Predictive Coding under the Free-Energy Principle"

This work details the relationship between the FEP and **Predictive Coding**, a neurobiological model of how the brain processes information. It proposes that the brain is organized hierarchically, with higher levels generating predictions about the activity of lower levels, and lower levels sending back prediction errors (the difference between the prediction and the actual input). The FEP provides the normative justification for this architecture, showing that minimizing variational free energy is mathematically equivalent to minimizing prediction error in a hierarchical system. The paper suggests that this process is implemented in the brain's laminar structure, with **superficial pyramidal cells** conveying prediction errors and **deep pyramidal cells** conveying predictions, thereby offering a plausible neuroanatomical basis for the FEP.

### 4. Friston et al. (2017): "The Desiderata of Life"

This paper extends the FEP to address the **fundamental properties of living systems**, or the "desiderata of life." It argues that any system that resists the second law of thermodynamics (i.e., maintains its integrity and organization) must possess a **Markov blanket**—a statistical boundary that separates the system's internal states from its external environment. The paper formalizes the necessary conditions for self-organization and autonomy, showing that the FEP provides a principled explanation for how living systems maintain their non-equilibrium steady-state. The desiderata include **autopoiesis** (self-making), **allostasis** (maintaining stability through change), and **teleology** (goal-directed behavior), all of which are framed as consequences of minimizing variational free energy.

### 5. Friston et al. (2015): "Active Inference and the Free Energy Principle"

This article focuses on **Active Inference**, a corollary of the FEP that unifies perception and action. Active Inference posits that agents minimize free energy not only by updating their internal beliefs (perception) but also by actively changing their sensory input through movement (action). This is achieved by selecting actions that are expected to minimize future free energy, which often translates to seeking out predictable or informative states. The paper highlights that action is a form of **Bayesian model selection**, where the agent chooses the action that best validates its internal model of the world. This framework provides a computational and neurobiological account for goal-directed behavior, exploration, and the active sampling of the environment.

### 6. Friston et al. (2021): "The Free Energy Principle: A Rough Guide to the Brain, Mind, and Behavior"

Intended as a pedagogical introduction, this paper provides a clear and accessible **"rough guide"** to the FEP. It explains the core concepts—variational free energy, surprise, and the Markov blanket—and their implications for understanding the brain, mind, and behavior. The authors emphasize the FEP's scope, which extends beyond neuroscience to encompass all self-organizing systems. The paper clarifies how the FEP is not a specific model but a **mathematical principle** that constrains all viable models of biological self-organization, providing a common language for disciplines ranging from theoretical biology to cognitive science.

### 7. Friston et al. (2025): "What the Flock Knows That the Birds Do Not: Exploring the Emergence of Joint Agency in Multi-Agent Active Inference"

This paper explores the emergence of **collective knowledge and joint agency** in multi-agent systems using the Active Inference framework. By modeling a flock of birds as multiple interacting Active Inference agents, the authors demonstrate that the collective can be treated as an **emergent agent** with its own statistical boundary (Markov blanket). The key finding is that the flock exhibits **synergistic information**, meaning it encodes information about the environment (e.g., a predator's location) that is not available to any single bird. This work provides a formal, information-theoretic framework for understanding how collective behavior can give rise to new levels of autonomy and implicit collective knowledge.

### 8. Clark (2013): "Whatever Next? Predictive Brains, Situated Agents, and the Future of Cognitive Science"

Andy Clark's influential target article provides a **critical examination and strong endorsement** of the "hierarchical prediction machine" approach, which is largely synonymous with Predictive Processing and the FEP. Clark argues that this approach offers the **best clue yet to a unified science of mind and action**. He explores how the brain's constant attempt to match sensory input with top-down predictions unifies perception, action, and attention. While acknowledging conceptual and evidential challenges, the paper concludes that the predictive processing framework fundamentally changes our understanding of the mind, portraying the brain as a situated, proactive agent rather than a passive input-processor.

### 9. Hipólito et al. (2021): "Markov Blankets in the Brain"

This paper applies the concept of the **Markov blanket**—a statistical boundary that mediates interactions between a system's internal and external states—to **partition the brain into functional units**. The authors argue that this construct provides a formal basis for understanding the brain's architecture at multiple scales, from individual neurons (where the blanket is defined by synaptic dynamics) to cortical columns and large-scale networks. The paper emphasizes that the Markov blanket structure is **recursively iterated**, meaning each component of a Markov-blanketed system can itself be a Markov-blanketed system. This approach highlights the limitations of traditional "modular" views of brain function by emphasizing the multiscale nature of functional segregation.

### 10. Kirchhoff et al. (2018): "The Markov Blankets of Life: Autonomy, Active Inference and the Free Energy Principle"

This work addresses the **autonomous organization of biological systems** by considering their boundaries in terms of **Markov blankets** under the Active Inference scheme. The authors argue that any living system is a Markov-blanketed system, and that a collective of Markov blankets can **self-assemble** into a global system that itself has a Markov blanket. This demonstrates how autonomous systems are hierarchically composed of nested, self-sustaining boundaries, from individual cells up to an entire organism. The paper also distinguishes between "mere active inference" (which applies to any system with a Markov blanket) and "adaptive active inference" (which enables autonomous organization and is characteristic of life).

### 11. Laukkonen et al. (2025): "A Beautiful Loop: An Active Inference Theory of Consciousness"

This paper proposes a **computational theory of consciousness** called the **"Beautiful Loop Theory,"** grounded in Active Inference. The theory posits that consciousness arises from a recursive, self-evidencing loop in a hierarchical system. It outlines three conditions for consciousness: the simulation of an **epistemic field** (a world model), **Bayesian binding** (inferential competition to enter the world model), and **epistemic depth** (recurrent sharing of Bayesian beliefs). The authors propose a **hyper-model** for precision-control, whose latent states encode and control the overall structure of inference, leading to the **field-evidencing** of the system's own existence. This framework is used to explain altered states, meditation, and provides a path toward building general and flexible intelligence.

### 12. Mangalam (2025): "The Emperor's New Pseudo-Theory: How the Free Energy Principle Ransacked Neuroscience"

This preprint presents a **strong and uncompromising critique** of the Free Energy Principle (FEP). The author argues that the FEP is an **unfalsifiable pseudo-theory** that has "ransacked" neuroscience by offering a seemingly all-encompassing but ultimately vacuous explanation for brain function. The critique focuses on the FEP's high level of abstraction, its reliance on mathematical formalisms that are difficult to test empirically, and the perceived lack of concrete, novel predictions that cannot be explained by simpler, existing theories. The paper challenges the scientific utility and explanatory power of the FEP, suggesting it functions more as a philosophical or conceptual framework than a rigorous scientific theory.

### 13. Marcus (2001): *The Algebraic Mind: Integrating Connectionism and Cognitive Science*

Gary Marcus's book is a foundational work in cognitive science that argues for the necessity of **symbolic, algebraic operations** in the mind, challenging the pure **connectionist** (neural network) view prevalent at the time. Marcus contends that while neural networks are powerful, they struggle to account for the human capacity for **compositionality** (combining concepts to form new ones) and **systematicity** (applying the same operation to different inputs). He proposes that the mind must integrate both a connectionist-style learning mechanism and a **computer-like symbol-manipulation system** to fully explain human cognition, particularly in areas like language and reasoning.

### 14. Oizumi et al. (2014): "From the Phenomenology to the Mechanisms of Consciousness: Integrated Information Theory 3.0"

This paper presents the formal mathematical framework for **Integrated Information Theory (IIT) version 3.0**, a leading theory of consciousness. IIT starts from **phenomenological axioms** (e.g., consciousness is specific, structured, and integrated) and formalizes them into postulates about physical mechanisms. The theory posits that consciousness is identical to the **maximally irreducible conceptual structure (MICS)** generated by a complex of mechanisms that maximizes **integrated information ($\Phi_{Max}$)**. $\Phi_{Max}$ is a measure of the causal power of a system to specify a whole that is more than the sum of its parts. The paper provides the mathematical tools to quantify both the quality (MICS) and quantity ($\Phi_{Max}$) of consciousness in any physical system.

### 15. Palacios et al. (2020): "On Markov Blankets and Hierarchical Self-Organisation"

This paper uses computational simulations based on the FEP to demonstrate how **hierarchical self-organization** can emerge from the principle of variational free energy minimization. It shows that **Markov blankets**—statistical boundaries—can **self-assemble** at successive hierarchical levels (a "Markov blanket of Markov blankets"). The simulations illustrate that this hierarchical emergence occurs when the microscopic elements of an ensemble have a prior belief that they participate in a macroscopic Markov blanket. This work provides a proof of concept for how the FEP can explain the nested, self-evidencing, and **autopoietic** (self-maintaining) behavior observed in biological systems across multiple scales.

### 16. Parr and Friston (2025): "How Do Inner Screens Enable Imaginative Experience? Applying the Free-Energy Principle to Attention"

This paper presents a model of **imaginative experience** (including planning and episodic memory) and **attentional control** within the FEP framework. It introduces the concept of **"inner screens"**—internal boundaries with the structure of Markov blankets—that function as classical information channels. The authors show how this formal structure supports imaginative experience by allowing it to employ the same spatio-temporal and object-recognition reference frames used in ordinary perception. The paper addresses the questions of how imaginative experience is internally generated yet can still be surprising, emphasizing the roles of **thermodynamic energy flows** and **metacognitive control** in regulating both imaginative and non-imaginative experience.

## Random Suggestions from ai that doesnt understand preferences:

This gives the author a way to say:

> “Consciousness is emergent **in the strict technical sense used by Rosas et al.** — where a macro-level ε-machine becomes causally autonomous relative to substrate.”

This is the strongest possible version.

---

# **PLAN: How to Address the Critiques Using Rosas et al. (2024) to Support Emergent Consciousness**

---

## **1. Clarify That the Paper Advocates Emergentist Consciousness, Not Identity Theory**

### Reviewer concern addressed

* Hard problem is still open
* Ambiguity about metaphysics

### Fix

Add a subsection:

**“Consciousness as Strong Emergence in the Rosas et al. Sense”**

Explain that the author endorses **computational emergence**, not reductive identity or dualism.

### Before → After

**Before:**
“Consciousness is what it feels like from the inside of a hierarchical information-compression system…”

**After:**

> “This paper adopts a **computational emergentist** view of consciousness. Following Rosas et al. (2024), a macro-level process counts as emergent when:
> (1) its ε-machine achieves causal decoupling from micro-dynamics,
> (2) it forms a self-contained predictive model, and
> (3) micro-informed predictors confer no additional advantage.
>
> Consciousness, on this view, is **the macro-scale ε-machine describing structural-coherence detection** that becomes causally autonomous relative to neural microstates.”

---

## **2. Tie Consciousness Directly to Computational Closure**

### Reviewer concern addressed

* Lack of mechanistic clarity
* Overuse of metaphor

### Fix

Insert explicit formula from Rosas:

> Emergence = ε-machine(Macro) ≡ υ-machine(Micro)

Then claim consciousness satisfies this criterion.

### Before → After

**Before:**
“Consciousness is the subjective experience of high-level information compression.”

**After:**

> “Consciousness is the macro-scale computational process whose causal dynamics satisfy the Rosas et al. emergence condition:
> [
> \epsilon_{\text{macro}} ;\equiv; \upsilon_{\text{micro}}
> ]
> That is, predicting future conscious states requires only the macro-state (structural representation), not the full neural microstate. Conscious experience is therefore an **emergent macro-level ε-machine**, not a micro-level identity.”

---

## **3. Use Rosas et al. to Justify Why Conscious States Are Real and Causally Efficacious**

### Reviewer concern addressed

* Consciousness might sound epiphenomenal
* Need clearer justification of emergence

### Fix

Add language from Rosas:

* Macro-level emergent processes are **causally real**
* They have **autonomous dynamics**
* Substrate becomes **causally irrelevant**

### Before → After

**Before:**
“The macro-level becomes causally autonomous.”

**After:**

> “In the Rosas et al. framework, consciousness is not epiphenomenal. Once the conscious-level ε-machine forms, it becomes **a causally real process** whose dynamics are **autonomous relative to the neural implementation**. Microstates realize experience but no longer determine its evolution:
>
> * Neural substrate = constitutive
> * Conscious dynamics = causally governing”

This directly addresses a major reviewer worry.

---

## **4. Use Rosas et al. to Distinguish “Weak” vs. “Strong” Emergence**

### Reviewer concern addressed

* Is consciousness just convenient description?
* Or real causal level?

### Fix

Add:

* Weak emergence: pattern recognizable
* Strong emergence: ε-machine autonomy + substrate-independence

Then place consciousness in the second category.

### Before → After

**Before:**
“Consciousness emerges from information compression.”

**After:**

> “Consciousness qualifies as **strong emergence** (Rosas et al.) because:
>
> * its macro-level state transitions form a closed dynamical system
> * prediction at the conscious-level is not improved by neural micro-details
> * the conscious ε-machine is **the minimal sufficient causal model**
>
> Thus consciousness is not merely a useful fiction, but a causally potent emergent stratum.”

---

## **5. Revise the Hard Problem Section to Show the Paper’s Scope Is Modest But Grounded**

### Reviewer concern addressed

* Need realistic framing
* Avoid overclaiming

### Fix

Add:

* The hard problem persists
* But Rosas et al. gives a precise functional target for what consciousness *is*

### Before → After

**Before:**
“This does not solve the hard problem.”

**After:**

> “This framework does not attempt a reductive solution to the hard problem. Instead, following Rosas et al. (2024), it provides a **precise functional characterization** of the phenomenon to be explained: consciousness is the macro-level ε-machine responsible for structural-coherence detection. The explanatory gap remains, but the nature of the explanandum becomes sharply defined.”

Reviewers will *love* this.

---

## **6. Reduce Overreach by Showing That the Rosas Framework Is General Enough to Support Multiple Views**

### Reviewer concern addressed

* Too much reliance on Free Energy Principle
* Over-metaphorization

### Fix

Add a paragraph:

> “The Rosas et al. framework does not require FEP. It only requires compressible multi-level dynamics. Thus this account is compatible with PP, FEP, GWT, IIT, embodied cognition, etc.”

### Before → After

**Before:**
“The Free Energy Principle underlies…”

**After:**

> “Although this paper employs information-theoretic language, the **conceptual architecture does not depend on the Free Energy Principle**. Rosas et al. emphasize that emergence is a general computational phenomenon arising whenever macro-states compress micro-dynamics without predictive loss. Consciousness, on this view, is emergent whether the underlying neural model is FEP, PP, or some non-Bayesian architecture.”

---

## **7. Revise Consciousness Section to Emphasize What Rosas Makes Rigorous**

### Reviewer concern addressed

* Consciousness explanation sounds hand-wavy

### Fix

We rewrite the subsection header:

**Old:** “Phenomenology of Compression”

**New:**
**“Phenomenology as Macro-Level Computational Closure (Rosas et al.)”**

Then integrate:

* conscious states = causal macro-level
* unconscious = micro-dynamics without closure

### Before → After

**Before:**
“Consciousness is what structural pattern recognition feels like…”

**After:**

> “Consciousness corresponds to the **macro-level computational process** whose structural-coherence representations form a self-contained dynamical system. As Rosas et al. show, when a macro-level ε-machine obtains, its transitions are fully determined by the macrostate—not the microstate. This is what allows conscious states to have distinct causal roles while being realized by neural dynamics.”

---

## **8. Add a New Diagram or Explanation: Consciousness as ε-Machine Hierarchy**

This addresses the “not formal enough” critique.

### Insert a simple conceptual diagram:

**Neural Microstate (υ-machine) → Structural Representation (ε-machine) → Conscious Macro-ε-machine**

Show:

* substrate
* representational layer
* conscious closure

Reviewers like diagrams.

---

# **Ready-to-Paste Paragraph for the Paper**

Here is a fully polished insertion that will satisfy reviewers:

> **Consciousness as Computational Emergence (Rosas et al. 2024).**
> The view adopted here is that consciousness is an **emergent macro-level process** in the strict computational sense developed by Rosas et al. (2024). On this framework, a process is emergent when its macro-level ε-machine achieves **causal decoupling** from the micro-level υ-machine, meaning that future macro-states are fully predicted by the current macro-state, and micro-level details confer no further predictive power. Conscious processes meet this criterion: the system’s representation of structural coherence—logical, causal, and counterfactual relationships—forms a **self-contained dynamical system** whose transitions are determined by macro-level informational structure rather than by neural substrate details. Consciousness is therefore not epiphenomenal but a **causally real emergent level**, autonomous in the Rosas sense while fully realized in neural dynamics. This does not solve the hard problem but reframes it: the explanandum becomes the **emergent macro-ε-machine** responsible for representing structural coherence, rather than arbitrary neural activity.”
