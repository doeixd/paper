Abstract
The paper proposes a way to naturalise Charles S. Peirce’s conception of the scien -
tific method, which he specified in terms of abduction, deduction and induction. The 
focus is on the central issue of the economy of research in abduction and self-correc-
tion by error reduction in induction. We show how Peirce’s logic of science receives 
support from modern breakthroughs in computational neuroscience, and more spe -
cifically from Karl Friston’s statements of active inference and the Free Energy Prin-
ciple, namely the account of how organisms’ capacity to decrease the discrepancy 
between the expected value and actual outcomes entails the minimisation of errors 
in their hypotheses about the world. A scientific account of organisms’ capacity to 
choose policies and form expectations is aligned with Peirce’s theories of abduction 
and induction, and especially with the economy of research. The upshot is the recov-
ery of Peirce’s theory of the logic of science in the context of active inquiry.

1 Introduction
Peirce offers a plausible theory of scientific method consisting of the three inter -
locking stages of reasoning types, namely abduction, deduction and induction. The 
two ends, abduction which suggests a hypothesis by a sort of a scientific guess, and 
induction which tests the models, are mediated by deduction that infers from the

hypotheses classes of testable predictions. The three have specific qualities comple-
menting each other. Abduction is the least secure but the most fertile of the three 
and the only one that can suggest altogether new ideas. Induction is likewise fallible 
but it gives stronger reasons to adopt its provisional conclusions because those con-
clusions have “been reached by a rule of inquiry which persistently followed will 
ultimately correct any error into which it may have led the inquirer” (R 905, 1907).
1 
Deduction, upon which Peirce takes the two other modes of reasoning to depend is, 
by contrast, the most secure as it “concludes no fact not a part of the state of things 
that its premisses assert” (ibid.). These three inference’s distinctive qualities are the 
economy of research (abduction), analysis and necessary reasoning (deduction), and 
self-correction by error reduction (induction).
There have been a few remarkable attempts at unpacking and defending the eco-
nomic and non-epistemic aspects of Peirce’s theory (Rescher, 1976, 1978; Wible, 
1994). More recently, these ideas of Peirce kindled new interest (Chiffi & Pietarinen, 
2019a, b; Chiffi et al., 2020; Mayo, 2005; Pietarinen, 2014, 2018). In this paper, new 
grounds are explored in support of Peirce’s naturalistic theory of scientific reason-
ing, especially induction and abduction, with a focus on Peirce’s theory of the econ-
omy of research. We will have more to say on deduction – the crucial link between 
abduction and induction and the basis of reasoning upon which the other modes 
repose – in another context, as that important part will not find enough room for 
exposition in the present paper. In brief, deduction is by no means limited to the type 
of necessary reasoning characteristic of mathematical demonstrations. In Peirce’s 
theory, deduction consists of logical analysis (or the theory of real definitions) and 
demonstrative reasoning (R 905; Pietarinen & Bellucci, 2014). The former involves 
the development of logical tools, systems and diagrammatic notations to perform 
tasks to analyse various phenomena, while the latter concerns actually carrying out 
deductive reasoning steps in two distinctive fashion, namely as corollarial (‘trivial’) 
or theorematic (‘creative’) inferences. This latter distinction, unlike the former, has 
been rather extensively discussed in the literature. Moreover, reasoning about prob-
abilities (the doctrine of chances) is also part of the deductive mode of reasoning 
(and not induction) in Peirce’s logic of science. In the present paper, we endeavour 
to show that there is some remarkable intellectual affinity between these classical 
ideas and the recent statements of the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and its corollary 
theory of active inferences.

Although the enterprise in this paper is basically philosophical, the grounds that 
we are unveiling are mainly scientific. We assume that the attempt at reinforcing 
our philosophical pursual with scientific grounds would be plausible both from a 
Peircean perspective and some new naturalist takes on philosophy (such as Beni, 
2019a; Ladyman & Ross, 2007). This paper aims to account for the self-correcting

mechanisms of induction and the economic character of abduction that underpin 
scientific activity in terms of recent breakthroughs in computational neuroscience. 
That is to say, it grounds Peirce’s logic of science, and especially abduction and 
induction, in a recent scientific study of some specific natural phenomena: organ-
isms’ predictive processing mechanisms, their prediction error minimisation ability, 
and their nearly uncanny capacity for staying in the state of homeostasis with their 
environment are the kinds of naturalised phenomena that Peirce specified in terms 
of surprises, guesses, expectations and anticipations guided by the considerations of 
the economy of research (abduction), as well as in terms of reliable error reduction 
in self-correcting processes (induction). In short, the paper draws on FEP and active 
inference to defend and vindicate a broadly Peircean account of scientific inquiry.
FEP lies at the nub of a viable scientific account of perception-cognition in terms 
of probabilistic inferences. Among others, FEP provides a general framework that 
unifies the Bayesian brain theory, game-theoretic account of natural selection (May-
nard Smith & Price, 1973), and neuro-computational theories of action, cognition, 
perception, and consciousness (Friston, 2010; Friston & Frith, 2015; Friston & Ste-
phan, 2007). FEP has been used to explain how organisms’ capacity to decrease the 
discrepancy between the expected value and actual outcomes entails the minimisa-
tion of errors in their hypotheses about the world. Peirce wondered how our guesses 
at hypothetical explanations can at least sometimes turn out right, and often enough 
so that discovery and scientific progress ensue that would not be possible should the 
guesses be blind and draw upon unsystematic procedures. In the light of abductive 
guesses, FEP serves as the generalised guiding principle for active inferences, infer-
ences that can change the organisms’ internal states according to the expectations 
that the organism entertains. It also explains how multi-scale directedness of living 
beings leads to the choosing of such strategy profiles (general habits of action) and 
stable policies that through organisms’ forming of new expectations allow them to 
optimise their cognitive grip on the world. The upshot of the present paper then is 
that FEP’s account of prediction error minimisation, thick depth of its generative 
models, and policymaking support Peirce’s pioneering account of the logic of scien-
tific inquiry.
The paper is structured into the following sections. It proceeds immediately 
by outlining Peirce’s conception of scientific inquiry with the focus on Peirce’s 
notion of induction first (Sect.  2). Section  3 outlines FEP and explains how FEP 
as an emerging research program in computational neuroscience supports inductive 
reasoning as a real faculty of cognition. It is shown that FEP’s account of predic-
tion error minimisation provides a biological basis for the explication of inductive 
self-correcting processes. In Sect. 4, the paper returns to Peirce’s text, outlines his 
notions of abduction and expectation, and revisits his theory of the economy of 
research. In Sect. 5, the paper moves on to show how abduction and the economy 
of research can be cashed out in terms of FEP. These notions are accounted for in 
terms of the organisms’ ability to make temporally thick generative models that can 
accommodate expected values and future-oriented hypotheses about the world. In 
the coda of the paper (Sect. 6), it is explained that the Peircean conception of scien-
tific method is realistic in the strong sense in which it is aligned with what our mod-
ern science (in terms of FEP) tells us about scientific practices as evolved forms of

basic prediction error minimisation mechanisms in the natural world. We conclude 
the paper by submitting that the same basic mechanisms that maximise the survival 
of fit organisms also underpin abduction and the economy of research, and (pending

grammatic reasoning; see Pietarinen & Beni, 2021a, b) Peirce’s inferential theory of 
scientific inquiry in general.
2  I nduction and the self‑correcting thesis
Science is an agent-based and action-oriented collaborative social and ecological 
enterprise. Its goal-directed activity is rendered by actual human beings as cogni-
tive agents who are situated in specific social contexts and ecological environments 
(Magnani, 2009, 2017). There are already theories of philosophy of science that 
acknowledge this point (Beni, 2019a; Giere, 1987, 2010; Weisberg, 2007). However, 
none of the mentioned philosophical enterprises is fortified with a viable account of 
the logical method of scientific inquiry.
We submit that scientific practice is underpinned by non-deductive and strategic 
rules of action that are ampliative, defeasible, and non-monotonic (Chiffi & Pietar -
inen, 2018; Gabbay & Woods, 2005, 2006; Hintikka, 2007). These rules are liable to 
annulment or correction, and the conclusions that are drawn from their premises are 
tentative and revisable. Scientific hypotheses are “accepted on probabtion” (Peirce, 
1913): they are sensitive to context and the agent’s or institute’s goals and inter -
ests; the issue of their demarcation is not to be represented as a simple decision tree. 
Despite being aware of this fascinating complexity, we intend to restore a sophisti-
cated, flexible, and scientifically defendable account of scientific methods based on 
Peirce’s pioneering work. His account of what scientific methods are to address the 
question, first, in terms of the theory of abduction, and more specifically in terms of 
economic considerations, considerations of costs and benefits of scientific research, 
including the quality of uberty (fruitfulness grounded on truth) that some such suc-
cessful scientific hypotheses are endowed with (Peirce, 1913; Pietarinen, 2020). 
Such economic considerations outweigh the choice of hypotheses that are worthy of 
being tested as candidates for good theories as well as the mechanisms of verifying 
those hypotheses (see Chiffi & Pietarinen, 2019a, b). Considerations of utility and 
cost of research can find a normative status as a non-epistemic value in such con-
texts (Chiffi et al., 2020).
After choosing viable hypotheses (with expected uberty), scientists subject the 
hypotheses to empirical tests. They strive to improve upon the formulation of fledg-
ing theories on the basis of feedback from experimentation. This is the inductive 
phase. Induction is a tricky notion and it could be unpacked in a number of ways. 
According to Deborah Mayo’s reading, Peirce provides an ingenious conception of 
induction in terms of reliability, in the sense that inductive mechanisms ensure the 
trustworthiness of inferences on the basis of “the ability to control error probabili-
ties of test procedures” (Mayo, 2005, p. 301). Mayo phrases Peirce’s theory of trust-
worthy or reliable inductions in terms of self-correction:

Self-Correcting Thesis SCT: methods for inductive inference in science are 
error correcting; the justification for inductive methods of experimental testing in 
science is that they are self-correcting. (Mayo, 2005, p. 299)
Mayo also argues that this understanding of scientific induction is in line with sta-
tistical approaches to error-reduction, rather than Bayesianism which may be prone to 
subjectivism. It could be contended that the statistical approach to error reduction is 
concerned with quantitative aspects of induction and as such does not consider qualita-
tive induction, meaning that although Peirce’s thesis indicates why theories approach 
truth in the long run, it fails to explain how the rejected theories come to be replaced 
by better ones (Mayo, 2005, p. 302; Rescher, 1978). Mayo convincingly argues that the 
objection unnecessarily construes induction in the context of orthodox theories such 
as Hempel’s H–D model or straight rule. Mayo, on the other hand, argues that the reli-
ability of scientific induction is due to its capacity to reduce errors or be self-correcting. 
Since Peirce’s three stages of reasoning form an organic and interconnected whole of 
the logic of science, one could add that induction alone is not self-correcting, but that 
the full cycle of the three stages of scientific reasoning (abduction-deduction-induction) 
is (Pietarinen & Bellucci, 2014).
Error reduction (also self-correction or error-correction, as Mayo calls it) is an 
experimental process that finds clear statistical expression. It needs to satisfy two main 
conditions (Mayo, 2005, pp. 305–306).
1.
 Er
ror reduction should allow for learning from the results of confrontation 
between the theory and evidence, so that the method could detect the discrepancy 
between predicted and actual outcomes.
2. The me
thod should be able to check its own premises so that in the case of detect-
ing error they (i.e., errors) could be subtracted from the methods of analysis of 
pieces of evidence.
On top of these two conditions, data that is going to be tested must be garnered 
actively, and it is here that the notions such as serendipity, preparedness and epistemic 
imperatives (as leading principles of reasoning) lord over scientific endeavours in gen-
eral (see also Bellucci & Pietarinen, 2020a, b; Chiffi & Pietarinen, 2019a, b; Pietarinen 
& Bellucci, 2014; Pietarinen & Beni 2021b). Moreover, the process of error reduction 
may reduce the discrepancy between predictions and observations but need not elimi-
nate predicted errors completely. At any rate, induction consists in an error-correcting 
or error reducing mechanism. Next, we describe the FEP and show how it could be 
used to naturalise the main aspects of Peirce’s account of scientific reasoning.

3  T he free energy principle and the error‑correcting mechanisms 
of inductions
According to Mayo (2005), Peirce’s account of induction was based on statistical 
self-correcting mechanisms whose reliability could be further substantiated. In this 
section, we will unfold the cognitive basis of induction and error-correcting mecha-
nisms and account for their reliability in scientific terms.
There is a flourishing framework of computational neuroscience that can provide 
a viable (and almost objective) reliable error-reducing mechanisms of cognition. We 
outline this theory and exploit it to argue that the most conspicuous virtue of Peirce’s 
account of the scientific method is its agreement with the facts that a state-of-the-art 
theory of cognitive science can reveal about how human beings draw models of the 
causal structure of the world. Below, we will flesh out the key requisite details.
We (as cognitive agents) generate models of (or hypotheses about) the causal 
structure of the world, and use these generative models to represent the causes of 
our sensations through statistical inferences. Historically, this probabilistic-infer -
ential approach to perception was introduced to neurophysiology by Hermann von 
Helmholtz in the nineteenth century. More recently, Karl Friston and his collabora-
tors have developed such early theories on numerous occasions and rephrased them 
under the rubric of the Free Energy Principle (FEP). The status of FEP as a theory 
of cognitive science has been controversial, and some (see e.g. Colombo & Hart-
mann, 2015; Colombo & Wright, 2016) challenge its theoretic status while others 
(Beni, 2018a, 2019b) defend it. What is less controversial is that FEP provides a uni-
fying framework that subsumes various streams of research in cognitive science. It 
comprises Bayesian theories of cognition (Daw et al., 2005; Dayan et al., 1995), pre-
dictive processing theory (Rao & Ballard, 1999) and optimal decision theory (Knill 
& Pouget, 2004) (for a review of the history see Friston, 2012a). FEP unifies these 
theories of optimisation and supplements them with an evolutionary account of the 
organisms’ dynamical interactions with their environment. Organisms do not have 
direct access to the causal structure of the world and could represent it through top-
down mechanisms of probabilistic active inferences.
To preserve the state of homeostasis, organisms must be able to optimise their 
probabilistic inferences and their models/hypotheses. FEP’s framework provides a 
basis for accounting for the organism’s optimal capacity for representing the world’s 
causal structure on an inferential-probabilistic basis. Integral to FEP’s account of the 
agent-world dynamical relationship is the notion of “active inference”. The notions 
of surprise, active inference, and its top-down mechanisms of information process-
ing now provide a scientific framework for grounding Peirce’s theory of scientific 
inquiry. Also, although FEP is related to the family of Bayesian theories, its formal 
framework could be construed either in terms of statistical frequencies or incorpo-
rated into an entropy-based framework altogether (see Beni, 2018b for details). The 
latter would ease the friction between having to choose either frequentism or Bayesi-
aning as the foundation of probabilities in this particular argument.
3
3 This is also in t he (implicitly) Peircean spirit of Jaynes (1995/2003: xii) who writes: “[N]either the 
Bayesian nor the frequentist approach is universally applicable, so in the present more general work we 
take a broader view of things. Our theme is simply: Probability Theory as Extended Logic. The “new”

Free energy is an information-theoretic measure (Friston, 2010, p. 2). Assuming 
that s
 ~
 is t
he set of sensory signals, p(s˜, ϑ|m) is the probabilistic (generative) model 
m that generates sensory consequences s
 
~
 
from their causes ϑ, and q(ϑ) is recogni-
tion density or the probabilistic representation of environmental causes. With these 
constructs in place, we can define the free energy in the following way.
which, in case that perception optimises prediction, can be states as
This expression shows that free energy is a bound on the negative log evidence or 
surprisal -ln p(s~|m). Minimising free energy thus entails the principle of maximum 
entropy, according to which amongst all posterior probabilities of a state the distri-
bution with the largest entropy
 <-ln 
q(ϑ)>
 q
 represents the state best (Friston, 2013). 
This should be contrasted with the entropy of sensory data, which is the expected 
surprisal
 
<-ln p(s~|m)>
 . Gener
ally, the entropy of sensory states tends to increase, 
but in order to resist the dispersing effect of the environment (i.e., the second law of 
thermodynamics), organisms can place an upper bound on their sensory entropy by 
minimising free energy. Organisms that keep their free energy low are, on average, 
found in the sensory states that are consistent with their generative model m; that 
is, with the kinds of sensations they expect to encounter. As this formulation indi-
cates, mechanisms of hypothesis-making that FEP describes are based on top-down 
predictions: hypothesis-making processes begin with internal (generative) models 
within the organism’s (embodied, cognitive) system. It is only after constructing the 
more refined classes of hypotheses with the aid of the intermediary of deductive 
abilities that the agent tries to test her predictions by seeking and finding confirming 
evidence through sampling the environment. A generative model is defined in terms 
of the joint probability over causes and data. It comprises likelihoods, which are the 
probabilities of sensory data, given the causes of sensation (Friston, 2010, p. 3), and 
prior beliefs over the causes. The inversion of a generative model corresponds to 
active inference based on predictions about the sensed world. Accordingly, percep-
tion is a process of reducing prediction error, in the sense that perception consists 
in “inverting the likelihood model (mapping from causes to sensations) to access 
the posterior probability of the causes, given sensory data (mapping from sensations 
to causes)” (Friston, 2010, p. 3). Hypotheses that the organism entertains about the 
world generate predictions about the results of the agent’s encounter with her world. 
Generating plausible predictions by analysis, articulation and refinement comes 
round to the natural correlate to the deductive stage in Peirce’s logic of scientific 
inquiry, mapping forms of the model into other forms by a series of transformations 
F =− ⟨lnp(s ∽ , /u1D717�m )⟩q + ⟨lnq(/u1D717)⟩q
F = D(q(/u1D717�/u1D707)‖p (/u1D717�s ∽ ))− lnp(s ∽ �m )(assuming/u1D707= argmax Divergence)
perception amounts to the recognition that the mathematical rules of probability theory are not merely 
rules for calculating frequencies of “random variables”; they are also the unique consistent rules for 
conducting inference (i.e. plausible reasoning) of any kind”. Jaynes could almost have inserted the term 
“abduction” within the parentheses.

on representations of the model so that the predictive material is put under the clear-
est light in the conclusion. The organism then endeavours to sample data from the 
environment in order to confirm her hypotheses. This, in turn, is to make (weak) 
inductions. Sensory inputs, as pieces of evidence, get tested against the predictions. 
Perception, therefore, results from a comparison between the top-down flow of pre-
dictions and the upward going flow of evidence. The brain (or the organism’s body 
plan overall) uses the discrepancy between predicted input and evidence (i.e., sur -
prisal) to update beliefs about the causes of perceptions that are beyond the evi-
dentiary boundary (Hohwy, 2014). This, in turn, involves abduction (Pietarinen & 
Beni, 2021a, b), the initial stage in the logic of science. Perception comprises error-
correction which is the same thing as error-reduction in the sense that the organism 
revokes its primary hypothesis about the world or revises it on the basis of the feed-
back received from the comparison between predicted inputs and actual inputs. This 
is sometimes referred to as self evidencing.
Returning briefly to Mayo’s construal of Peirce’s account of induction, it can 
be assumed that it is SCT, the self-correction thesis, which is the cornerstone of 
Peirce’s theory of induction. Mayo also proposed that self-correcting mechanisms 
should satisfy the two conditions (1)–(2) stated above. This means that the mecha-
nisms should allow learning from the results of confrontation between the theory 
and evidence so that the method could detect the discrepancy between predicted out-
comes and actual outcomes. They should also be able to check their own premises 
so that in the case of detecting error those errors could be subtracted from the meth-
ods of analysis of pieces of evidence. Mayo also submitted that evidence and data 
that confirm hypotheses should be randomly garnered. As the broad-brush outline 
that we have depicted above indicates, all of these factors are present in FEP and its 
account of prediction error minimisation. We now proceed to a specific account of 
the fit between Peirce’s account of induction and FEP.
SCT can be cashed out in terms of Prediction Error Minimisation (PEM) which 
is inbuilt into cognizer’s systemic structures. PEM provides a basis for (some) 
organisms’ capacity to be able to adjust their hypotheses about their environment 
based on the feedback that they receive when they compare their expectations 
with their environment and surmise that there are discrepancies and errors. This 
refers to the first condition that Mayo associated with SCT. Indeed the scientific 
method should be sensitive to discrepancies and errors. FEP could explain how 
this condition could be satisfied in the natural world, namely based on top-down 
prediction error minimisation mechanisms that are arranged hierarchically. This 
means that generative models of causes of sensation at each level of the system 
generate causes at the lower level, down to the sensory data at the lowest level 
(Friston, 2010, p. 3). The discrepancy between generative models and sensory 
data indicates that the generated models of causes were not precise enough. FEP 
also accounts for the satisfaction of the second condition, explaining how it is 
that some organisms could revise their premises with reference to the hierarchi-
cal mechanisms of PEM. After spotting the discrepancy between the predicted 
inputs and the actual ones, the system uses this discrepancy (i.e., free energy or 
surprisal) and updates models of causes at each level up to the prior models of 
the causes at the topmost level. Reducing error and minimising free energy is

tantamount to one another, and a given organism could minimise its free energy 
not only by passively updating its generative models but also by action via inter -
vening in the environment as well as sampling evidence randomly. The update of 
the priors (or revising premises, according to Mayo’s vocabulary) is partly the 
result of the environment’s enforcement of sensory impressions on the agent’s 
cognitive system, while the agent too could change the states of the environ-
ment. Action can reduce free energy by intervening in causes of sensations in 
the external world and thus manipulating sensory inputs (Friston, 2009, p. 295). 
For example, if I find myself looking at the sun, I can either note – with some 
surprise – “I am the sort of creature that can look at the Sun”. Or, alternatively, I 
will immediately look away, fulfilling my prior beliefs that “I am not sort of crea-
ture that looks at the sun.” Clearly, if I am not the sort of creature that can look at 
the sun, actively sampling the right kind of visual sensations will underwrite my 
adaptive fitness.
It is worth emphasising that FEP characterises actions as evidentiary inference, 
by associating them with policies. In other words, policies are ordered sequences 
of actions selected to minimise free energy expected after following a course of 
action (Hohwy, 2014, p. 271). Agent’s perceptual mechanisms are alloyed with 
action to reduce surprises on the basis of their general policy for maximising 
survival. This means that “action and perception are integral parts of the same 
inferential process and one only makes sense in light of the other” (Friston et al., 
2013, p. 2). To minimise their entropy (i.e., the average of surprisal or uncer -
tainty), the organisms endeavour to intervene with the causes of their sensory 
inputs and shape them according to their internal models of the world. Thus, the 
second condition of SCT can be explicated based on FEP too.
Finally, we remember that Mayo suggested that induction should be under -
stood in terms of “reliability” and “trustworthiness”. FEP can be used to account 
for the reliability of induction too. But in the Peircean framework, the reliability 
of induction is to some extent connected with the antedating economic considera-
tions that prevail in abduction. Thus, we can account for the reliability of the sci-
entific method in this sense (Sect. 5) and then explain how FEP accounts for the 
trustworthiness and reliability of PEM (or SCT).
Similar considerations underpin accounts of the cognitive basis of abduction 
too and are taken up in Sect. 4 next. For the time being, suffice it to say that the 
problem of reliability in FEP’s framework can be addressed in terms of the role of 
the success of the organism’s hypotheses in maximising the survival of the organ-
ism. Inductive mechanisms of organisms that minimise their prediction error suc-
cessfully are reliable in the sense that they can get updated economically. In this 
respect, FEP draws its force from its connection with theoretical biology. There 
are evolutionary reasons to explain why agents need to be able to optimise their 
models of the world. Metaphorically speaking, natural selection favours organ-
isms whose neurocognitive systems are developed in a way that enables them to 
optimise their prior expectations objectively, namely, by updating their internal 
models of hidden causes on the basis of sensory evidence. Hence error reduction 
mechanisms are reliable. Next, we shall proceed to abduction in the context of 
Peirce’s philosophy.

4  A bduction, expectations and the economy of research
Peirce’s account of induction is linked with his theory of abduction and serves as a 
partial justification of the latter (Bellucci & Pietarinen, 2020a, b). In brief, abduction 
concerns “the process of forming explanatory hypotheses” and is “the only logical 
operation which introduces any new idea” (CP 5.171, 1903). As Peirce discusses the 
novelty of abduction in connection to his philosophy of pragmati(ci)sm, his identifi-
cation of the notion in these 1903 Harvard lectures develops in his later years into a 
promising account of future-oriented expectations. Wible paraphrases this point by 
remarking that, “Peirce’s theory of expectations is embedded in his conception of 
mathematics and cognition in an evolutionary world.” (Wible, 2019, p. 20).
It is important to be clear about the meaning of Peircean expectations. Expecta-
tions are results of general, stable and enduring habits that organisms must take and 
possess in order to survive in a world that offers specific opportunities and affor -
dances for survival.
4 Expectations concern the possibility of an agent’s conjectures 
turning out true. They concern what Peirce termed “possible and esperable uberty” 
of hypotheses that are conjectured. The “esperable uberty” is the quality of those 
hypotheses that are endowed with some “value in productiveness” (Peirce, 1913). 
Such values are not only epistemic values. Uberous hypotheses are those that in Pei-
rce’s terms are “gravid with young truth” (ibid.). He is not talking plainly about the 
truth and falsity of hypotheses. By “young truth” he appears to mean the values that 
scientists consider hypotheses to have as soon as their further analyses necessitate 
the application of also some non-epistemic values such as considerations of econ-
omy. Moreover, such general suggestions at the modalities of what “may-be” need 
not be grounded on fully articulate, intersubjectively contestable reasons. Modifica-
tions of internal data could result in the formation of such expectations. Yet Pei-
rcean expectations are not singular states of mind. Nor are they concerned with what 
individual decision-makers happen to contemplate in any given epoch of time, given 
that expectations on what would follow from adopting certain hypotheses on proba-
tion have some important collective, communal and social dimensions.

Although we can thus find support to Peirce’s theory of science in the findings 
of contemporary computational neuroscience, the ultimate meaning of expectations 
is not intended to be psychologistic, that is, determined by theories of psychology. 
Likewise, in order to be able to produce novel fruitful scientific theories that can 
accommodate new predictions, we must be able to specify new patterns of relations 
between classes of phenomena. Scientists demarcate some hypotheses as worthy 
5 These dimensions ar e sketched somewhat further in Beni & Pietarinen (2021a).
4 This tec hnical meaning of expectations is different from its common meaning, which Peirce bundled 
with notions such as desires, wishes and intentions. The latter are not general otherwise than through 
connection with a concept. These notions do not give”ultimate intellectual interpretants” (R 318; EP 2: 
430, 1907) and thus not the meaning of signs, as the meaning that they have has to be effected by refer -
ence to concepts. Expectations in futuro, in turn, appear in “mental forms” (CP 2.86) as intentions do, 
but do not concern conceptual meaning but the “mental effects of the signs that they interpret” (R 318; 
EP 2: 431). Such expectations are given in conditional forms (subjunctives), while singular expectations 
as such are merely non-conditional judgments.

of further testing and scrutiny under fundamental uncertainty, on the basis of their 
expectations about novel experimental results of those hypotheses in the future. 
What matters as to the value of such hypotheses is both the interconnectedness of 
evidence, often sparse, between the number of guesses that had to be made during 
their generation, and the expected novelty and gain, should those hypotheses be on 
the right track. Attempts at reducing uncertainty about the future outcomes of fron-
tier sciences and discovery are explicated by Peirce under the rubric of abduction. 
Indeed abduction is the type of reasoning “that creates hypotheses to account for the 
surprising facts by guessing” (Chiffi et al., 2020, p. 2; Pietarinen, 2014). Scientific 
guesses are particular kinds of sampling processes concerning open-ended future 
states of affairs.
The meaning of expectation can now be cashed out in terms of the notion of sur-
prise, which Peirce (1905) explicitly took on board only after his more famous but 
merely promissory Harvard scheme of abduction, when he described the abduction 
as “Reasoning from Surprise to Inquiry”: given a (surprising) fact  C, if  A implies  C, 
then it is to be inquired whether  A plausibly holds. Like abduction elsewhere in his 
writings, this later schema begins with an observation of a surprising fact or event, 
and through a conditional major premise concludes, in a ‘co-hortative’ mood which 
Peirce termed “the investigand” (Ma & Pietarinen, 2018), that something ought to 
be done. By asserting conjectural conclusions in such investigand moods, those con-
jectures become the ratified subjects of inquiry: the purpose of future inuiry is then 
to find out whether they plausibly are the matters of course.
Peirce wanted to, first, characterise abduction in ways that would avoid earlier 
conflations of it with induction (and with IBE, see e.g. Seth, 2014 for an example 
of such conflation), and to provide a more nuanced expression of its logical, lin-
guistic and semiotic forms than was possible with the rough sketch given of it in his 
1903 Harvard Lectures. For one, Peirce added the investigand mood to qualify how 
abduction’s conclusion is to be asserted as a matter of fact.
These points aggregate into a preliminary basis upon which one could begin to 
discern how FEP can contribute to naturalising abduction. Free Energy itself is a 
mathematical bound on surprisal on sampling some data, and surprisal is the nega-
tive log-probability of an outcome (Friston, 2010, p. 2). We will elaborate on this 
point in the next section, but for the time being, suffice it to state that because scien-
tists’ predictions of the future results of given hypotheses are based on their conjec-
tural expectations, expectations about the future turns of events have a central status 
in the context of Peirce’s theory.
Peirce’s theory of abduction, in turn, and supplemented with his theory of econ-
omy of research (Peirce, 1876), provides a forward-looking theory of demarcating 
hypotheses that could (in futuro) lead to the discovery of real patterns or at least 
underlie promising streams of inquiry that are not altogether dislodged from the 
reality of the patterns in the world. Time, resources and energy prevent all hypoth-
eses to be submitted for further verification and one has to choose hypotheses that 
are put in our docket based on considerations of the economy such as costs and 
benefits that override all other considerations (CP 5.602). Our expectations of what 
happens in the future provide a cognitive basis for our calculation of costs and ben-
efits. Error correction mechanisms are associated with the mechanisms of projecting

1 3
expectations onto the future. Error correction consists of revising inaccurate expec-
tations and increasing their precision based on the feedback from the encounter with 
observations.
What Peirce states, already a year before the 1903 Harvard lectures, was:
Looking at an expectation referring to the distant future, something, for exam-
ple, which you propose to do, it is very little distinguished from a mere “may 
be.” There is a sort of picture in your imagination whose outlines are vague 
and fluid. You do not attach it to any definite occasion, but you think vaguely 
that some definite occasion there is, to which that picture does attach itself, 
and in which it is to become individualized. (CP 2.146, “Why Study Logic?”, 
1902)
This quotation epitomises many of Peirce’s most important views on abduction 
that he in the coming years would much refine, including a qualification to what 
these “may-bes” are in terms of invitations to inquiry (Ma & Pietarinen, 2018; Pie-
tarinen & Bellucci, 2014). There is also an important iconic and imaginative char -
acter to abductions to be noted (Bellucci & Pietarinen, 2016, 2020a, b; Champagne 
and Pietarinen, 2018). In the present paper, however, another important implication 
of Peirce’s remarks is advanced by resources made available by recent theoretical 
and experimental psychology, especially in view of his continuing interest in the 
anatomy of the brain and the early neurosciences (Cristalli & Pietarinen, 2020; 
Pietarinen, 2006). Surely Peirce’s approach not only allows for but recommends 
drawing on science itself in support of his philosophical ideas. In fact, Peirce’s phi-
losophy of science is so scientific-minded
6 that claiming it to be based on thought-
ful speculation would be seriously off the mark. Peirce’s account of the scientific 
method in terms of abduction and the economy of research is plausible not only 
on such philosophical grounds but also because scientific facts support and validate 
it. In the next section, we endeavour to provide some such essential ingredients for 
a scientific basis for naturalising Peirce’s theory of the economy of research and 
abduction.
5  F ree energy principle, expectations and abduction
Recently, naturalising abduction has been advanced in several works, including 
Magnani (2009) and Park (2017). A general remark on the possibility of drawing on 
the resources of modern psychology in support of Peirce’s theory of abduction has 
been made in Chiffi et al. (2020). Boltzmann machines are examples of neural nets 
that perform inverse reasoning from effects to causes. Moreover, Murray Shanahan 
had explained how an account of abductive perception could be developed in the 
6 Among o ther places, this is evident in Rescher’s interpretation of Peirce’s take on science, according to 
which, “Science is autonomous. Corrections to science must come from science... The mistaken results 
of science can be improved or corrected only by further results of science. There can be no recourse at 
this point to tealeaf reading, numerology, the Delphic oracle or the like” (Rescher, 1978, p. 160).

context of robotics and AI with an eye to theoretical notions of top-down informa-
tion processing and active inferences under uncertain circumstances. In developing 
his account of expectation as the basis of top-down mechanisms, Shanahan submits 
that despite possible consequences, to the extent that his enquiry is at issue, “the aim 
is not necessarily to achieve psychological or biological plausibility but to produce a 
well-engineered mechanism” (Shanahan, 2005, p. 108).
The objective of this paper is to provide an alternative, moderately psychologi-
cal and biological account of those top-down information-processing mechanisms 
that underpin abduction in human cognition in general and in scientific methodol-
ogy in particular. In the previous section, it was explained that Peirce’s theory of 
the scientific method is importantly characterised by his central notion of scientific 
expectation. According to Peirce, “Our knowledge of any subject never goes beyond 
collecting observations and forming some half-conscious expectations, until we find 
ourselves confronted with some experience contrary to those expectations” (CP 
7.36). Wible clarifies: “The abduction could start with some awareness of a surprise 
or an unexpected anomaly. An abduction is the idea that might make sense of that 
surprise. As such an abduction amounts to a hypothesis that is worthy of investiga-
tion” (Wible, 2019, p. 25). FEP, we go on to propose, provides a theoretical handle 
on naturalising expectations and abduction.
As the overview of FEP in Sect. 3 indicated, organisms with objectively revised 
prior expectations can maximise their survival because, first, they can invest in reli-
able hypotheses about their environment, and second, they can adjust their hypoth-
esis in light of surprise or prediction error. As explained, the agent acts on the basis 
of those expectations. As a result of the agent’s action, the environment changes and 
furnishes new posterior probability distributions that provide new evidence for the 
agent’s models. The agent samples from the new observations and update its internal 
models and acts again. Free energy is the bound or limit on the agent’s entropy or 
surprisal, meaning that for the agent to survive, the divergence between its expected 
values and control states (as parts of generative models that refer to approximate 
Bayesian posteriors) shall not exceed appropriate bounds on free energy. In order to 
increase their chance of nourishment and prosperity and avoid dangers that lead to 
the extinction of their species, organisms must be able to form hypotheses that lead 
to reliable expectations. For instance, to maximise their survival, a fish must expect 
to remain in the water and a camel must expect survival in the desert, everything 
else being equal. A fish that expects to survive in the desert or a camel that expects 
to remain alive under the waves will minimise their survival (Friston, 2012b). Unre-
alistic expectations do not contribute to the organism’s overall fitness and its sur -
vival. Mere judgmental (non-conditional) expectations won’t suffice, either. There 
needs to be experimentation that evaluates real expectations, guesses upon what 
could be happening next, and those are expressed as hypothetical, defeasible forms 
of conditionals.
This speaks directly to Peirce’s conception of expectations and their optimisation. 
According to Peirce’s nearly final formulations of abduction,
Every inquiry whatsoever takes its rise in the observation, in one or another of 
the three Universes, of some surprising phenomenon, some experience which

1 3
either disappoints an expectation, or breaks in upon some habit of expecta-
tion of the inquisiturus; and each apparent exception to this rule only con-
firms it. There are obvious distinctions between the objects of surprise in dif-
ferent cases; but […] inquiry begins with pondering these phenomena in all 
their aspects, in the search of some point of view whence the wonder shall be 
resolved. At length a conjecture arises that furnishes a possible Explanation, 
— by which I mean a syllogism exhibiting the surprising fact as necessarily 
consequent upon the circumstances of its occurrence together with the truth of 
the credible conjecture, as premisses. (EP 2: 440-1, CP 6.469, 1908)
Of course, the form of abduction that is liable to logical characterisation is far 
more advanced than the primary mechanisms of expectation formation and habit 
taking. However, the essential capacity lies there at that basic level. Peirce, too, 
agrees that the formation of reliable systems of belief demands to avoid the disap-
pointment of expectations; that is, to avoid surprises.
When faced with surprises, revising beliefs becomes a costly business. Peirce 
agrees that when forming these inferences, the organism favours its internal hypoth-
eses and tries to garner confirming evidence for them (CP 6.469, 1908).
7In any case, 
FEP provides a viable account of how biological systems in the real world manage 
to minimise their surprisal or prediction error, with an equal effort as that which has 
to do with maximising their expectations.
Organisms that have the capacity to invest in primary models (or hypotheses) 
of the environment and revise their hypotheses efficiently maximise their survival. 
Such organisms succeed in optimising their expected value. The expected value can 
be characterised in terms of the utility function of the organisms’ states on the basis 
of evidence that the organisms can garner. In order to maximise their fitness, organ-
isms must be able to optimise their expectations of the world. Expectations find a 
clear technical definition here, given that fit organisms must maximise their expected 
value expediently and economically. In this context, “perfect rationality corresponds 
to choosing states from a low temperature distribution, whose probability mass is 
concentrated over the state with the highest value” (Friston et al., 2013, p. 2). Here, 
organisms’ capacity for updating the priors underpins the epistemic (or intrinsic) 
value of their expectations (identified with the decrease in uncertainty) (see Fris-
ton et al., 2015). This provides a scientific basis for explicating Peirce’s notions of 
expectation and abduction. To be more precise, FEP’s account of expected values 
are ingredients of the cognitive psychology of expectation which provides a basis 
for Peirce’s future-looking theory of abduction, which he began to sketch in his 1902 
“Why Study Logic?” in terms of “general cognitions of potentialities in futuro” 
which, “if duly constructed, will under imaginary conditions determine schemata or 
imaginary skeleton diagrams with which percepts will accord when the real condi-
tions accord with those imaginary conditions” (CP 2.148).
7 Suc h favouritism may explain some of the nearly automatic attunement of the human mind to the cog-
nitive biases of confirmation, optimism, and the like; a topic addressed in another paper (Bobrova and 
Pietarinen, 2020).

1 3
While what our knowledge of such conditional expectations determines as such 
“skeleton diagrams” can be given rather precise logical explications (Pietarinen & 
Beni, 2021a, b; Gaultier, 2017; Pietarinen, 2015), the notion of expectations is wor -
thy of additional significance and meaning drawn from what the guiding principles 
of such cognitive reasoning processes consist of. FEP’s account of optimisation of 
expected value is realistic in the sense that it takes into account the cost of informa-
tion processing that brings about maximisation of the expected value of survival. 
In this sense, FEP also provides a basis for naturalising Peirce’s account of the 
economy of research, amounting to cost-utility calculation. Action (as an inferential 
process) can be modelled in terms of cost-utility decision problems in biological 
contexts that assign survival value to optimised beliefs about the causal structure 
of the world. Here too organisms have no direct access to the casual structure of the 
world, as the vital information of how to reach global minima are hidden from the 
organisms’ model of the landscape. They can only form hypotheses about the causes 
of sensations indirectly, through the experience already encoded into their genera-
tive models, and by experimenting upon the forms those models possess, leading 
to informed guesses about what is going to happen next so that, at least once in a 
while and sufficiently often, they are tipped off onto the right track. The inferential 
mechanisms that are described by FEP are future-oriented in the sense that the agent 
builds upon evidence for its generative models in order to minimise uncertainty 
about causes that have valuable outcomes in the future. To maximise its survival, 
the organism must minimise its entropy and maximise its expected value by find-
ing evidence for its hypotheses about the world. Not all hypotheses about the world 
are worth taking seriously, and expending a ‘full cost model’ of time and energy 
to check upon their validity status would be an existential mistake. The discrep-
ancy between some of the hypotheses that the organisms make and the world is too 
great and the complexity of some others too high to allow for efficient revision of 
such hypotheses. Such hypotheses are to be revoked and replaced by those that can 
be revised on the basis of mechanisms of Prediction Error Minimisation and FEP. 
Organisms (or their sub-units) that do embody such conjecture-making mechanisms 
maximise their fitness and will survive. This provides a scientific basis for ground-
ing Peirce’s account of abduction and expectation in nature at multi-scale levels.
6  T emporally thick models, policies and the economy of research
In this last section, some supplementary notes are provided on the technical aspects 
of the FEP-based account of goal-directedness of actions and future-orientedness of 
expectations as a basis for naturalising abduction and expectation.
The expectations of the organisms whose course of action can minimise their 
free energy are related in the right way to their environment, and the optimisation 
of their cost-utility matrix is based on objective facts that provide a basis for their 
expectations in facing states of the world in future. It is this foresight into expected 
free energy that allows the agents to decrease the discrepancy between their gen-
erative models and hidden causes of sensation efficiently. Successful action in the 
environment is defined in terms of optimal behaviour which is dependent on the

1 3
success of the agent in dissolving uncertainty by minimising expected free energy 
(Friston et al., 2015, pp. 201–204). Here, the important belief is that organisms not 
only could form hypotheses about the world, but at least some organisms can also 
model their expectations about the world to themselves based on their hypotheses 
about the future states of the world (Friston, 2018, p. 579; Friston et al., 2015). Such 
models are named temporally thick models in Friston’s theory, and the key point 
here is that some organisms’ active inferences and active sampling of data are based 
on the distribution of posterior beliefs over action, under the prior belief that action 
will minimise free energy in the future and not only in present (Friston, 2018, p. 
279). By temporally thick models, one can account for the organism’s agentive and 
purposeful behaviour (Friston, 2018, p. 579; Friston et al., 2015). This provides the 
basic elements needed for naturalising the Peircean account of expectation and the 
economy of research.
Technically, the notion of ‘economy’ figures prominently in the minimisation of 
variational free energy, in FEP’s account of future-oriented mechanisms of demar -
cating effective strategies or policies from inefficient ones, given that some organ-
isms possess the capacity to infer and select the policy that, if consistently pursued, 
will contribute to minimising the expected free energy effectively (Chen et al., 2019; 
Friston et al., 2015; Ramstead et al., 2019).
The story proceeds as follows: the imperative to self-evidence is met by inference 
and learning to minimise free energy, as specified previously in this paper. Note 
that the log evidence and (negative) surprisal are the same thing. This means that 
minimising surprise is equivalent to maximising model evidence. Crucially, log evi-
dence can always be decomposed into accuracy minus complexity. This means that 
minimising surprise is equivalent to providing an accurate account of the sensorium 
that minimises complexity. Interestingly, acting to minimise expected surprise can 
also be associated with minimising expected complexity (known as  risk in econom-
ics and Bayesian statistics), while at the same time minimising expected inaccuracy 
(also known as ambiguity). In other words, when minimising expected free energy 
there are epistemic and pragmatic components to any choice; namely, ambiguity and 
risk. The epistemic part means that much of our behaviour is about seeking infor -
mation and reducing uncertainty; that is, reducing instances of expected surprise 
(Hohwy, 2014; Friston et  al., 2013). Risk is particularly interesting, given that it 
refers to the expected complexity, which scores the computational complexity cost 
of any model or hypothesis. In this sense, an ‘economic’ sampling of the environ-
ment is exactly the minimisation of expected complexity cost.
Peirce proposed the qualities of incomplexity (simplicity), breadth and caution as 
the leading characteristics of the economy of scientific hypothesis-making. The gen-
eral question then is that given a set of prima facie plausible hypotheses produced 
in a given research project, and given the capita that can be invested in their futher 
pursuit (fiscal, cognitive or otherwise), which of the many projected hypotheses 
should disqualify from being submitted to severe test? To mitigate risks, the quality 
of incomplexity (absence of complexity, simplicity) recommends that because few 
hypotheses are expected to be optimal in any case, they should at least “give a good 
leave” (EP 2:110): any promising hypothesis slated to be refuted should at least set 
an example of a good conduct to be followed, by attempting as large a ‘break’ as 
94   Page 16 of 21 European Journal for Philosophy of Science (2021) 11: 94

--- Page 17 ---

1 3
possible from it, as that would increase the possibility of discovering new hypoth-
eses from it. Breadth gestures at unification: those hypotheses are to be favoured 
that are extendible in the sense of covering more ground under slightly different per-
spectives or adjusted boundary conditions – or can explain the unexpected in some 
new domains, as may happen in cross-disciplinary contexts. Caution is the economic 
quality of avoiding diminishing marginal returns by skilfully breaking down (by 
choosing a suitable method of analysis and approach to interrogation) big questions 
into series of small questions that can be adequately answered by the investment at 
hand that the conditions of the research proposal permit. For example, if questions 
are broken down to binary yes–no questions (such as to an exact definition of the 
null hypothesis), one is at once effectively and logarithmically reducing the size of 
the search space.
Of course, not all policies that the organism can pursue would maximise its sur -
vival, just as not all hypotheses will lead to fruitful scientific theories. Thus, organ-
isms must be able to choose the right policies that provide an adequate future-ori-
ented basis for reliable action-guiding beliefs of the organism. Policies that could 
maximise the organism’s survival are based on optimal error minimisation mecha-
nisms in the future (see Ramstead et al., 2019, p. 7). Thus the evolutionary basis of 
optimisation of the organism’s expected value of policies contributes to naturalis-
ing Peirce’s conceptions of abduction, expectation, and the economy of research. 
This is because – to state the situation somewhat metaphorically – natural selec-
tion favours organisms that pursue strategies that lead to the minimisation of the 
expected free energy effectively over organisms that fail to do so. Such organisms 
make optimal and precise models of the future states of affairs of the world based 
on their expected free energy. The models are optimal in the sense that they could 
decrease the discrepancy between expected values and control states effectively. 
Fit organisms are those that rely on strategies that successfully minimise the dis-
crepancy between generative models’ prediction and hidden causes of sensory data. 
This optimises the future-oriented inferences or expectations of such organisms and 
decreases their uncertainty. The reliability of the organism’s probabilistic inferences 
and the choice of policies that maximise survival rely on one another, as “inferences 
about policies depend upon inferences about hidden states and vice versa” (Friston 
et al., 2013, p. 2). Evolutionary considerations lead to a realist understanding of the 
reliability of the strategies that an organism pursues to maximise its survival effec-
tively. In this sense, future-oriented inferences of organisms that can maximise their 
survival are anchored to the real world.
7  Conclusions
The paper drew on a free energy account of neuro-computational mechanisms 
of top-down processing and active inferences in biological cognitive agents to 
fortify Peirce’s theory of abduction and expectations. The result is a revision-
ary reworking of the late nineteenth century conception of the scientific method 
as supported by recent science. That being the case, what makes this enterprise 
worthwhile is the compatibility of the scientific method (in terms of induction,

abduction, expectation, and the economy of research) with what our best scien-
tific theories can tell us about the actual mechanisms of cognition, namely active 
inferential mechanisms that agents use to self-represent the causal structure of the 
world. This naturalist approach to the scientific method is not only compatible 
with Peirce’s conception of scientific activity but further motivates and explains 
its essential ingredients.
In a wider perspective, FEP is not (exclusively) about human beings or their 
collaborations that lead to the formation of scientific theories. FEP and active 
inferences apply to a wide range of self-organising systems that tend to resist 
the dispersing effect of their environment by minimising the overall amount of 
their entropy. Some of such organisms happen to possess the wonderful capac-
ity to make temporally thick models of their future states and be conscious of 
their insights into their expectations and policies that subsume them. In order to 
engage in active inferences, the organism must be able to model the consequences 
of its action to itself (given that the consequences postdate the action). Models 
of organisms that can regiment the consequences of the actions are temporally 
thick, where the temporal thickness of models is associated with the purposeful-
ness and agency of the organisms. Thick models allow for the counterfactual for -
mulation of expectations and take into account both the strategic decisions to act 
(namely situations that are actually never reached) and the defeasible nature of 
their actions (namely those represented by counterfactuals that have cancellable 
antecedents). Organisms with temporally thick models can model predictive pos-
teriors that include beliefs about future outcomes, counterfactual outcomes, and 
hidden states, whereas the current posterior of the other kinds of complex sys-
tems covers only hidden states (Friston et al., 2015, p. 192). Some of the organ-
isms that draft temporally thick models or working hypotheses could indeed con-
struct exceedingly sophisticated hypotheses about their environment. They can 
demarcate promising hypotheses from barren ones. Promising hypotheses will be 
developed into flourishing theories in due course, whereas the barren ones will 
be left aside with memory traces on their failures imprinted on their informa-
tion depositories. The choice is between those that carry what Peirce termes the 
‘uberty’ of hypotheses and those that do not. In brief, FEP’s account of prediction 
error minimisation, thick depth of its generative models, and policymaking have 
vindicated Peirce’s logic of scientific inquiry sketched over a century ago.
