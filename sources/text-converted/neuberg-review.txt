This book seeks to integrate research on cause and effect inference from cog-
nitive science , econometrics, epidemiology, philosophy, and statistics + It puts
forward the work of its author , his collaborators , and others over the past two
decades as a new account of cause and effect inference that can aid practical
researchers in many fields, including econometrics+ Pearl adheres to several prop-
ositions on cause and effect inference + Though cause and effect relations are
fundamentally deterministic ~he explicitly excludes quantum mechanical phe-
nomena from his concept of cause and effect !, cause and effect analysis in-
volves probability language + Probability language helps to convey uncertainty
about cause and effect relations but is insufficient to fully express those rela-
tions+ In addition to conditional probabilities of events , cause and effect analy-
sis requires graphs or diagrams and a language that distinguishes intervention
or manipulation from observation + Cause and effect analysis also requires coun-
terfactual reasoning and causal assumptions in addition to observations and sta-
tistical assumptions +
Chapter 1 sketches some of the ingredients of the new approach to cause and
effect inference : probability theory , graphs, Bayesian causal networks , causal
models, and causal and statistical terminology + Chapter 2 builds the elements
of Chapter 1 into a theory of inferred causation + Chapter 3 focuses on causal
diagrams and identifying causal effects + Chapter 4 studies intervention or ma-
nipulation and direct causal effects + Chapter 5 considers causality and struc-
tural equation models+ Chapter 6 examines Simpson’s paradox and confounding+
Chapter 7 blends structural modeling with counterfactual reasoning + Chapter 8
is an approach to imperfect random assignment experiments through bounding
effects and counterfactuals + Chapter 9 analyzes notions of necessary cause and
sufficient cause + Chapter 10 explicates a concept of single event causality + The
epilogue is a public lecture that Pearl gave at UCLA that , in mostly not too
technical language , places the new approach to causality within the long his-
tory of thought on the subject +
The interdisciplinary nature of the book , a great strength , at times makes it
difficult to read because its theory of inferred causation blends the languages

of econometrics and statistics , mathematical graph theory , and Bayesian net-
works with philosophical notions of cause and effect + However, Pearl facili-
tates reader understanding by using reasonably straightforward mathematics and
examples to help to connect the separate disciplinary discourses + Nevertheless ,
an only semiformal approach does not ease sorting the theory into assumptions
and deduced conclusions + The chapters less build one upon the next than take
cuts at the subject of causality from slightly different angles + Hence the reader
must struggle to sort assumptions from conclusions and to assemble the theory
from the slices + The book rewards perseverance in such an effort + Pearl deep-
ens one’s sense of the nuances involved in cause and effect inference and of-
fers intriguing proposals to deal with some unresolved conceptual issues in such
inference+
1. THE BASIC IDEAS OF THE THEORY OF INFERRED CAUSATION
By probability Pearl means degree of belief + Let V be a set of variables , pre-
ordered by hypothesized cause-effect relations , whose joint probability distri-
bution is P~v!+ He calls a minimal set of predecessors of any X
i in V that make
it independent of all of its other predecessors the Markov parents or immediate
causes ~PA
j ! of Xi + That is , if Qi ~$ PAj ! is the set of predecessors of Xi then
P~xj 6 pai ! 5 P~xj 6qi ! and the equality fails to hold if any proper subset of PAj
replaces PAj + The functional causal model associated with V is a set of equa-
tions of the form xi 5 fi~ paj , uj !, i 5 1,+++, n “where the Uj represent errors ~or
‘disturbances’! due to omitted factors” ~p+ 27! and the fi are functions +
From mathematical graph theory , Pearl takes a graph as a set of nodes with
some edges between them + Edges are either directed or not + Points, lines, and
arrows represent nodes , edges, and directed edges , respectively+ A path is a se-
quence of edges , and a cycle is a path with at least two edges that ends at the
node where it began + A directed acyclic graph ~DAG! is one with no cycles
whose edges are all directed + Pearl depicts the preordering of V by hypoth-
esized cause-effect relations with a graph whose nodes are the variables of V
where the arrows entering any node are from its hypothesized immediate causes +
So a causal structure consists of the set of variables V, its joint probability dis-
tribution P~v!, its preordering by hypothesized cause-effect relations , its func-
tional causal model , and its associated graph +
Pearl holds that his functional causal model concept “is a nonlinear , nonpara-
metric generalization of the linear structural equation models ~SEMs!” ~p+ 27!
of econometrics + The graphs associated with causal structures , developed by
him and others in Bayesian networks , resemble the path analytic diagrams that
the Wrights sought , only partially successfully , to introduce into econometrics
in the 1920s ~see Morgan , 1992, pp+ 178–179!+ Pearl stresses that in “linear
models, paj corresponds to those variables on the r +h+s++++ that have nonzero
coefficients” ~p+ 27!+

Pearl maintains that the absence in probability language of a way to distin-
guish setting a variable from observing it impedes the modeling of cause and
effect relations + He introduces “do ~x!” for setting X 5 x, and “x” for observing
X 5 x+ The expression “do ~x
j !” means to delete the arrows from PAj to Xj
from the graph and the equation xi 5 fi~ paj ,uj ! from the functional causal model
and to set Xj 5 xj in the right-hand sides of the other equations of a causal struc-
ture+ Pearl calls the mapping from x to P~ y6do~x!! for all x the causal effect of
X on Y+ He calls the mapping from ~x, paY \ X ! to P~ y6do~x!, do~ paY \ X !! for all
~x, paY \ X !, where paY \ X is a realization of the Markov parents of Y ~excluding
X !, the direct effect of X on Y+
Setting variables is not always ethical or possible + If P~ y6x! Þ P~ y6do~x!!,
Pearl says that there is confounding bias + He argues that even without setting
X 5 x one can sometimes estimate P~ y6do~x!! from observations and assump-
tions embedded in the graph of the functional causal model+ Whereas path analy-
sis uses arrows primarily to depict coefficients that are not a priori zero , Pearl
develops work on causality by analytic philosophers beginning in the 1950s
~see Eells , 1991, pp+ 59–80! into a fuller graphical formalism + In particular , he
shows that two graphical criteria are sufficient conditions for causal effects to
be expressible in terms of probabilities without the “do” operator +
A set of nodes , Z, blocks ~or d-separates! a path p if and only if p contains
a chain i r z r j with z [ Z, a fork i R z r j with z [ Z, or a collider
i r m R j with neither m nor any descendant of m [ Z+ Here Z satisfies the
back-door criterion relative to an ordered pair of nodes ~X,Y! in DAG G if no
node in Z is a descendant of X and Z blocks every path between X and Y that
contains an arrow into X+ Pearl proves that if Z satisfies the back-door crite-
rion relative to ~X,Y! then P~ y6do~x!! 5 S
z P~ y6x, z!P~z!+
The variable Z satisfies the front-door criterion relative to an ordered pair of
nodes ~X,Y! in DAG G if Z intercepts all paths from X to Y, there is no back-
door path from X to Z, and X blocks all back-door paths from Z to Y+ Pearl
proves that if Z satisfies the front-door criterion relative to ~X,Y! and P~x, z! .
0 then P~ y6do~x!! 5 Sz P~z6x!S x ' P~ y6x ', z!P~x ' !+
Figure 1 contains graphs of hypotheses of the causal relations among three
variables+ In ~i! Z is a common cause of X and Y, Z satisfies the back-door
criterion relative to ~X,Y!, and the Pearl adjustment formula makes intuitive
sense+ In ~ii! Z is not a common cause of X and Y, Z fails to satisfy the back-
door criterion relative to ~X,Y!, and to combine the direct and indirect causal
effects of X on Y no adjustment for Z makes intuitive sense + In ~iii! Z is not a
common cause of X and Y, Z fails to satisfy the back-door criterion relative to
~X,Y!, but adjustment for Z seems to make intuitive sense if X and Y are asso-
ciated+ That is , from an econometric perspective if Z and X are collinear then
shouldn’t one adjust for Z when assessing the effect of X on Y?
For Pearl a “node in a directed graph is called a root if it has no parents”
~p+ 13! “and root variables ~as the d-separation criterion dictates ! are indepen-
dent of all other variables except their descendants” ~p+ 25!+ So his graphical
BOOK REVIEWS 677

--- Page 4 ---

formalism appears to assume that the root nodes X and Z in Figure 1 ~iii! are
independent and hence not associated + The philosophical literature that Pearl
formalizes in his back-door criterion takes third variable common causes as the
only source of confounding bias + Yet Mill draws a distinction between “laws of
causation and collocations of the original causes” ~1973, p+ 348!+ Two associ-
ated causes of an effect can confound attempts to separate their impacts + In a
single equation linear model , this is the problem of multicollinearity , and the
Pearl approach appears to rule it out a priori +
Figure 2 contains a graph of a hypothesis of the causal relations among X,
Y, and Z+ That graph differs from Figure 1 ~i! in two respects + It contains a
new variable T that is an intermediate effect between cause X and effect Y,
and Z is now unobservable + That Z is unobservable makes application of the
back-door criterion to the fork X R Z r Y impossible+ However, T in Fig-
ure 2 satisfies the front-door criterion relative to ~X,Y! so that P~ y6do~x!! is
expressible in terms of probabilities and observable variables without the “do”
operator using the adjustment formula of that criterion + Pearl notes that this
conclusion is controversial , at least among statisticians , by quoting Cox : “the
concomitant observations @or those that one adjusts for # should be quite un-
affected by the treatment” ~p+ 81! and T is not unaffected by X+ Hence Pearl’s
graphical formalism suggests that in situations like Figure 2 , one should ad-

just for an intermediate effect when assessing the effect of X on Y, though
conventional statistical practice is not to do so +
The theory of inferred causation also leaves a puzzle about the indepen-
dence of causally unrelated variables + In the theory framework , doesn’t the
independence of causally unrelated variables Z and X, e+g+, root nodes , mean
that P~z6do~x!! 5 P~z! and P~x6do~z!! 5 P~x!? But does P~z6do~x!! 5 P~z!
imply that P~z, x! 5 P~z!P~x!?I f Z and X are causally unrelated but P~z, x! Þ
P~z!P~x! and one thinks that Z is a cause of Y, then isn’t adjustment for Z in
the back-door or front-door adjustment formula appropriate when finding
P~ y6do~x!!?
2. SEMs AND THE THEORY OF INFERRED CAUSATION
Pearl regards SEMs as a specialization—to linear functional causal models—of
his theory of inferred causation but claims that the algebraic language of SEMs
makes it hard to express causal assumptions + He argues that the left- and right-
hand sides of an SEM equation do not relate strictly algebraically : implicit is
the idea that the variables on the right cause the variable on the left + He won-
ders if “SEM practitioners have sought to gain respectability for SEM by keep-
ing causal assumptions implicit , since statisticians , the arbiters of respectability ,
abhor assumptions that are not directly testable” ~p+ 138!+
The probability formalism behind the Markov parent notion implies that one
can intervene in SEM equation i, i+e+, change f
i , without changing the other
functions+ To illustrate the difference between observing and intervening in in-
ferred causation , Pearl borrows a simple SEM from Arthur Goldberger :
q 5 b1 p 1 d1 i 1 u1,
p 5 b2 q 1 d2 w 1 u2 +
He notes that the Goldberger model graph is cyclic and refers to it as a “canon-
ical economic problem of demand and price equilibrium” ~p+ 215!+ He adds
Figure 2. The front-door criterion +
BOOK REVIEWS 679

--- Page 6 ---

that “q is the quantity of household demand for a product A , p is the unit price
of product A , i is household income , w is the wage rate for producing product
A, and u1 and u2 represent error terms—unmodeled factors that affect quantity
and price , respectively” ~p+ 215!+
Pearl asks two questions of the Goldberger model + First: “What is the ex-
pected value of the demand Q if the price is controlled at P 5 p0?” ~p+ 216!+
He answers that to set P 5 p0 is to replace the second model equation with p 5
p0+ He uses the independence of U1 and I to find that E @Q6do~P 5 p0!, i# 5
E~Q! 1 b1~ p0 2 E~P!! 1 d1~i 2 E~I!!+ Second, “What is the expected value of
the demand Q if the price is reported to be P 5 p0?” ~p+ 216!+ He answers that
both equations operate in this case and finds that E~Q6 p0, i,w! 5 b1 p0 1 d1 i 1
E~U16p0, i,w!+ He adds that the “computation of E @U16p0, i,w# is a standard pro-
cedure once @the covariance matrix #S ij is given +++ Note that, although U1 was
assumed to be independent of I and W, this independence no longer holds once
P 5 p0 is observed” ~p+ 216!+
Pearl also notes that the nodes “associated with the variables U1, U2, I, and
W are root nodes , conveying the assumption of mutual independence” ~p+ 28!+
In addition he observes that it “is well known in economics ~dating back to
Wright 1928 ! that the assumptions of linearity , normality, and the indepen-
dence of $I,W% and $U1,U2% permit consistent estimation of all model param-
eters including the covariance matrix Sij ” ~p+ 215!+ Hence precisely what
assumptions full answers to the two Pearl questions of the SEM require re-
mains slightly unclear +
As important as what assumptions Pearl uses to answer questions with the
Goldberger model is the question : How do SEMs and graphs relate? Wermuth
sought to clarify the relation “between graphical chain models for continuous
variables on the one hand and linear structural equations discussed in the econo-
metric +++ literature on the other hand” ~1992, p+ 1!+ Wermuth argued that a
SEM follows from its reduced form “by premultiplying the residual matrix +++
with an arbitrary nonsingular matrix ” ~1992, p+ 19!+ That suggested to Gold-
berger that Wermuth thought the reduced form more fundamental than the SEM
itself+ He responded that Wermuth was guilty of a “failure to pay attention to
the substance of the phenomenon being modelled by the economist” ~1992,
p+ 47!+ He introduced the SEM that Pearl borrows because its reduced form is
the equation Wermuth seemed to suggest was more fundamental , and then he
argued that the essence of the economics was in the SEM itself rather than its
reduced form +
However, one can go a step further than Goldberger did + He justified the
second equation of his SEM : “On the other side of the market , the price that
producers will charge is an increasing function of the quantity” ~1992, p+ 46!+
Consider another simple SEM with variables defined as for his :
q 5 a
1 p 1 c1 i 1 u1,
q 5 a2 p 1 c2 w 1 u2 +

Better than the Goldberger SEM , the new SEM captures the substantive eco-
nomic idea that in competitive markets all agents take prices as given + Most
remarkably, apparently no associated graph for the new SEM exists + Although
any graph has a corresponding class of SEMs , evidently not all SEMs are mem-
bers of a class with an associated graph +
The new and Goldberger–Pearl SEMs both embody an economic problem of
demand, supply, and price equilibrium , not just an “economic problem of de-
mand and price equilibrium ,” as Pearl maintains , because in both SEMs the
second equations are supply equations + A refinement clarifies the economic sub-
stance of the new SEM :
qD 5 a1 p 1 c1 i 1 u1,
qS 5 a2 p 1 c2 w 1 u2 ,
qD 5 qS
with qD the quantity of product A consumers want to consume and qS the quan-
tity of product A producers want to produce + A DAG of the first two equations
of the SEM exists , but no graph of the three equations together does + The third
equation represents the price-quantity equilibrium condition , not a cause-effect
relation+ SEMs might require a stretch of mathematical graph theory to encom-
pass equations of noncausal economic substance simultaneously with equa-
tions that may convey cause-effect relations +
However, do the first two equations of a demand-supply SEM such as the
new three-equation one actually reflect cause and effect relations as Pearl sug-
gests, i+e+, with effects on the left and causes on the right? Intervention and
expectations under intervention with the new three-equation SEM should
also reflect economic substance + For example , economic intuition of the effect
of government price controls suggests that setting P 5 p
0 ought to result in
E @QD 6do~ p!, i, w# 5 E @QS 6do~ p!, i, w# when p0 is an equilibrium price
and to result in deletion of the third equation and E @QD 6do~ p!, i, w# Þ
E @QS 6do~ p!, i,w# otherwise+ Government directly setting QD or QS —how much
consumers want to consume or producers want to produce—is hard to envi-
sion+ However, government can manipulate Q
D indirectly by altering con-
sumer utility functions , e+g+, by taxing consumption or declaring some illegal +
Government can also manipulate QS indirectly by altering firm production func-
tions, e+g+, subsidizing production or patenting a new technology + Such gov-
ernment manipulation of consumption and 0or production would replace SEM
demand and 0or supply equations with new ones but not with the constant func-
tions qD 5 qDo or qS 5 qSo that the Pearl approach suggests properly repre-
sents intervention +
So econometricians may not mention causal assumptions in demand-supply
SEMs—not to gain statistician approval ~as Pearl suggests!—but because inter-
ventions in such SEMs may occur at the implicit utility-production function
level+ Pearl sometimes uses physics analogies , and one seems apt here + The
BOOK REVIEWS 681

expression X ' 0+5gt 2 describes the distance X from the drop point of a falling
body near the earth’s surface in terms of time t elapsed+ Yet a physicist proba-
bly would not say that t causes X but rather that X ' 0+5gt 2 is the equation of
motion of the falling body + The equation follows deductively from Newton’s
universal gravity force and second laws + Change the force acting on the body ,
e+g+, superimpose a rocket force on gravity , and a new equation of motion fol-
lows deductively from the new force equations + Forces cause the motion +
A demand-supply SEM may be more akin to a Newtonian mechanical equa-
tion of motion than to something that directly embodies cause-effect relations +
The demand-supply SEM follows deductively from the utility-production func-
tion equations and profit and utility maximization , where the basic causes of
the market demand and supply relations may lie + How would graph theory rep-
resent the equations that imply the demand-supply SEM , the cause and effect
relations possibly embodied in them, and their mathematical relation to the SEM
equations? Is graph theory formalism adequate to represent the possibly com-
plicated cause and effect relations behind demand-supply SEMs?
3. RANDOM ASSIGNMENT EXPERIMENTS, SEMs, AND THE THEORY
OF INFERRED CAUSATION
Let x
' and x '' be values of X denoting treatment and control groups and let
u index units or subjects + Make the stable unit treatment value assumption
~SUTV A!, i+e+, each subject in a group receives identical treatment , the re-
sponse of a subject does not depend on the responses of other subjects , and
identical repetitions of an experiment result in identical responses + Then one
can represent the response of subject u as ~Yu~x '!,Yu~x '' !! ~where one and only
one of the components of the response is observable !, define the causal effect
of X on Y for u as Yu~x '! 2 Yu~x '' !, and define the average causal effect of X on
subjects as Su~Yu~x '! 2 Yu~x '' !!0N where N is the number of units + On this
view ~for a more detailed account , see Rubin , 1980! the purpose of cause and
effect inference is to say something about the ~Yu~x '! 2 Yu~x '' !!’s+ Pearl calls
this outlook on cause and effect inference the potential-outcome approach +
Pearl maintains that his theory of inferred causation incorporates , along with
SEMs, the potential-outcome approach and that the potential-outcome defini-
tion of causal effect is a special case of his own :
The difference E~Y 6do~x '!! 2 E~Y 6do~x '' !! is sometimes taken as the definition
of “causal effect” +++ where x ' and x '' are two distinct realizations of X+ This
difference can always be computed from the general function P~ y6do~x!!, which
is defined for every level x of X and provides a more refined characterization of
the effect of interventions + ~p+ 70!
Certainly he is right that P~ y6do~x!! for x ' and x '' implies E~Y 6do~x '!! 2
E~Y 6do~x '' !!+ However, he mistakes the potential-outcome definition of aver-
age causal effect for its unit-level definition of causal effect + Pearl’s approach
infers what for the potential-outcome approach is an average causal effect , but
682 BOOK REVIEWS

--- Page 9 ---

does his approach make room for inference of unit-level causal effects per se?
For example , how would Pearl’s theory encompass the Fisher randomization
test of the hypothesis that Yu~x '! 5 Yu~x '' ! for all u?
Pearl does argue that “the probability P~ y6do~x!! +++ may be interpreted as
the conditional probability +++ corresponding to a controlled experiment in which
X is randomized” ~p+ 184!+ So evidently P~ y6do~x!! and P~ y6x! are the same if
X is randomized + However, this appears to take “do x” beyond the mere setting ,
rather than observing , of X+ One can conduct an experiment in which one sets
X at various levels without randomizing X+ Pearl suggests that in an experiment
the setting of X is not sufficient for inferring causal effects—randomization is
necessary+
Consider a random assignment experiment , with causal inference within the
subject population only , that assigns n ~N 2 n! subjects at random to a treat-
ment ~control! group t ' ~t '' !+ There are then C~N, n! possible sets of observa-
tions, and the randomization makes each of them equally likely , i+e+, gives them
each probability 1 0C~N, n!+ That is , randomization is equivalent to random se-
lection of subjects for whom the treatment group response will be observed
and for a simultaneous nonindependent random selection of subjects for whom
the control group response will be observed +
Let d be the difference between the mean of the observed Y
u~t '!’s and the
mean of the observed Yu~t '' !’s— i+e+, the difference between the mean observed
treatment response and the mean observed control response + On the potential-
outcome approach , given SUTV A, E~d ! 5 Su~Yu~t '! 2 Yu~t '' !!0N, the average
causal effect , where the expectation is over the C~N, n! possible sets of obser-
vations, each with probability 1 0C~N, n!+ Thus the randomization assures that d
is an unbiased estimate of the average causal effect , Su~Yu~t '! 2 Yu~t '' !!0N—
i+e+, that the estimate d entails no selection bias +
Let Y, T, and X be response, treatment, and blocking ~in the statistical sense !
variables, respectively+ For example , X may be an attribute on which sub-
jects are paired prior to the experiment and then assignment occurs randomly
within each pair + Rubin explains : “The physical act of randomization in the
experiment +++ is designed to ensure that all scientists will accept the specifi-
cation Pr ~T 6Y, X ! 5 Pr~T 6X !” ~1980, p+ 591!+ He adds : “If treatments are as-
signed using characteristics Z of the units that are correlated with Y +++ , then
Pr~T 6Y, X ! 5 Pr~T 6X ! would generally not be acceptable” ~1980, p+ 591!+
Rubin’s outlook blends into Pearl’s + On the graph theory approach , if treat-
ments are assigned using Z correlated with Y then Z becomes a third variable
common cause of Y and T, confounding the cause and effect relation between Y
and T+ Random assignment makes no Z a cause of T, and hence the assumption
that there are no third variable common causes of Y and T becomes plausible +
Then the average causal effect of T on Y is E~Y 6do~t
'!! 2 E~Y 6do~t '' !!, which
is evidently Su~Yu~t '! 2 Yu~t '' !!0N of the potential-outcome approach +
The Fisher randomization test answers the question : Is Yu~t '! 5 Yu~t '' ! for
all u? Rubin argues ~1980, p+ 592!: “More complicated questions , such as those
arising from the need to adjust for covariates brought to attention after the con-
BOOK REVIEWS 683

duct of the experiment , simultaneously estimate other effects , or generalize re-
sults to other units , require statistical tools more flexible than” the Fisher
randomization test + He adds : “Such tools are essentially based on a specifica-
tion for Pr ~Y 6X, Z!, where now Y refers to outcome variables in general , X re-
fers to blocking and design variables , and Z refers to covariates” ~p+ 592!+
However, the difficult question remains : What justifies a particular specifi-
cation of Pr ~Y 6X, Z!? For example , how does one know if one leaves out im-
portant variables or chooses inappropriate functional forms? Pearl’s emphasis
on the distinction between causal and direct effects may help to answer this
question, at least in the context of a random assignment experiment + If T is the
treatment variable with two settings in such an experiment , then the random-
ization certainly helps to answer the question of the Fisher randomization test :
Is Y
u~t '! 5 Yu~t '' ! for all u? Yet it does more than that : it underpins an unbiased
estimate of the average causal effect , E~Y 6do~t '!! 2 E~Y 6do~t '' !!+
An SEM is a way to specify Pr ~Y 6X, Z! where, in SEM language , X are en-
dogenous and Z are exogenous variables + One can certainly specify an SEM
and use it with data from the experiment , as Rubin suggests , to “simultaneous-
ly estimate other effects+” However, the effects that come directly from the SEM,
including the effect of T on Y if there are exogenous variables in the equation
with Y and T, are what Pearl calls direct effects+ The various direct effect esti-
mates of the SEM combine into an estimate of the average causal effect of T
on Y+ Cannot one compare that estimate of the causal effect of T on Y with the
randomization-based estimate of the same thing to judge the quality of the SEM
specification?
4. CONCLUSION
Pearl came to the issue of causality as an artificial intelligence researcher who
asked: “How do humans infer cause and effect relations?” He and others first
answered with the notion that humans implicitly employ Bayesian networks to
infer cause and effect relations + In Causality Pearl seeks , among other things ,
to extend his Bayesian network theory of causality to encompass what statisti-
cians and econometricians do to infer cause and effect relations + The book won
the 2001 Lakatos Award in Philosophy of Science and certainly poses an im-
portant challenge to econometricians trying to estimate economic cause and
effect relations +
Among the questions that the book poses for econometricians are the follow-
ing+ In judging if X causes Y, are there any possible sources of confounding
other than possible variables Z of which X and Y may both be effects? When an
econometrician tries to deal with multicollinearity is that econometrician doing
something connected to estimating cause and effect relations? If so , does Pearl’s
graph theory approach to causality provide anything that could help? If there
are situations where the graph theory approach says to adjust for intermediate
effects but statisticians say not to do so , how can we decide who is right? If all
SEMs do not have associated causal graphs , then is there something wrong with
684 BOOK REVIEWS

--- Page 11 ---

the graph theory approach to causality or something wrong with the SEMs that
do not have causal graphs?
Econometricians should read Causality and start contributing to the cross-
disciplinary discussion of the subject that Pearl has begun + Hopefully mutual
enlightenment will be the effect of our reading and talking about the book among
ourselves and with the Bayesian causal network thinkers +
