Life Rev 2018. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.plrev.2017.09.001 [this issue] motivate a multiscale characterisation of living 
systems in terms of hierarchically structured Markov blankets – a view of living systems as comprised of Markov 
blankets of Markov blankets [1–4]. It is effectively a treatment of what life is and ho w it is realised, cast in terms of 
how Markov blankets of living systems self-organise via active inference – a corollary of the free energy principle 
[5–7].
A Mark ov  blanket deﬁnes the boundary of a system, and can thus be understood as a universal requirement for life 
[6,8]. Crucially, a Markov blanket is a statistical partitioning of a system into internal states and external, environment 
states [6]. Speciﬁcally, the blanket itself consists of the states that separate internal and e xternal states; namely, active 
and sensory states [7]. Under the free energy principle, active inference, in its simplest formulation, describes the 
tendency of any random dynamical system to minimise (on average and over time) its variational free energy, where 
the free energy quantity functions as an upper bound on (ne gative)  marginal likelihood or evidence. In the context of 
Markov blankets, this means that the active and sensory states comprising a Markov blanket can be understood to work 
to optimise evidence for the dynamics underlying the organisation of a (living) system. In their survey, Ramstead et al.
propose that the very same statistical structure of a single Mark ov blanket (enveloping a cell, say) can be recapitulated 
at increasingly larger and larger scales of self-organisation, inducing a series of hierarchically nested systems such as 
the body of a single organism [1,2]. They claim that this multilayered view of Markov blankets of Markov blank ets  
follows from the existence of a single Markov blanket, where this Markov blanket is mandated by the fact that its 
internal states can be distinguished from its external milieu [8, p. 8].
In my opinion the thesis that the or ganisation of living systems consists of nested Markov blankets should be viewed 
as reasonably uncontroversial, even if non-trivially signiﬁcant. Yet there is nevertheless an apparent complication with 
Ramstead et al.’s preferred account. The problem is that the Markov blanket formulation of life is overbroad in its 
e
xplanatory scope. Indeed, Ramstead et al. mention that one can think of the surface of a cell or the skin membrane of 
an individual as a Markov blanket. But they also think it possible to cast particular nodes of the World Wide Web as 
possessing a Markov blanket. The scope of this formulation is lik ely to be too encompassing. If the Markov blanket 
formulation can apply to living things as well as non-living things (I assume that the internet or a pair of Huygens 
pendulums [6] are uncontroversially non-living), their proposal is open to being explanatorily vacuous. In other words,

the larger the scope of their preferred Markov blanket formulation, the less likely it is to say much about the speciﬁcs 
of living organisation [8]. In my opinion, the following distinction is underemphasised in their account: the difference 
between ‘mere active inference’ and ‘adaptive active inference’ [3]. The remainder of this commentary will speak 
to this distinction and address ho
w it might augment Ramstead et al.’s view of how life is realised and how it is 
maintained.
The main dif ference between ‘mere active inference’ and ‘adaptive active inference’ turns on the ability to sample 
over different actions, which, in turn, is based upon temporally – and therefore spatially – deep generative models that 
minimise the free energy expected under different (counterfactual) courses of action. A Markov blanketed system that 
e
xhibits only mere active inference cannot sample over counterfactual outcomes of its own actions. But, this ability is 
arguably an essential feature of the organisation of life – at least of life as we know it. This implies that not all Markov 
blanketed systems that engage in active inference are li ving.  Friston [6] associates a pair of Huygens pendulums with 
having a Markov blanket (the motion of the beam from which the pendulums are suspended). A pair of pendulums 
however cannot modulate their relation to the world, and therefore cannot be said to be able to adapt to a set of 
changing circumstances. The reason is that the dynamics of Huygens pendulums tak
e the form of a Markov chain 
over (successive) time. A Markov chain captures the idea that events are conditionally independent of previous or past 
events given the current state of the system [9]. Markov chained systems are thus ‘ensla ved’  by the dynamics of the 
here-and-now, viz., they do not exhibit adaptivity. Living systems are adaptive. Any adaptive system are not merely 
enslaved to their proximate conditions. This means that adaptive active inference is what enables living systems to 
make inferences about certain probabilistic future states and act to as to reduce the e xpected uncertainty associated 
with those future states [3,10].
The role of adapti ve active inference in self-organising and maintaining the organisation of living systems highlight 
why it is not enough that the same statistical form of a single Markov blanket can be generalised recursively at larger 
and larger scales of systemic organisation when accounting for the hierarchical (Markov blanketed) organisation of 
life. This means that what is important is that the kind of acti
ve inference that underlies the self-organisation of 
hierarchical Markov blankets is associated with adaptive, future (and backward) oriented dynamics. Adaptive active 
inference not only speaks to the species of dynamics required for something to be and remain alive, it also pro vides a 
means by which to appropriately restrict the explanatory scope of one’s account of life and its organisation.
