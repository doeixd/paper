TRUE ENOUGH*
CatherineZ.Elgin
HarvardUniversity
Epistemologyvalorizestruth.Sometimespractical,orprudential,orpolitical
reasons convince us to accept a known falsehood, but most epistemologists
deny that we can have cognitively good reasons to do so. Our overriding
cognitive objective, they maintain, is the truth, preferably the whole truth,
and definitely nothing but the truth (Goldman 1999, p. 5; Lehrer 1986, p. 6;
Bonjour 1985, p. 9). If they are right, then at least insofar as our ends are
cognitive, we should accept only what we consider true, take pains to insure
that the claims we accept are in fact true, and promptly repudiate any
previouslyacceptedclaimsuponlearningthattheyarefalse.Isuggest,however,
that the relation between truth and epistemic acceptability is both more
tenuous and more circuitous than is standardly supposed. Sometimes,
I contend, it is epistemically responsible to prescind from truth to achieve
moreglobalcognitiveends.

account. If I am right, theories and the understandings they embed have a
moreintricatesymbolicstructurethanwestandardlysuppose.Nevertheless,I
do not think that we should jettison concern for truth completely. The
question is what role a truth commitment should play in a holism that
recognizesamultiplicityofsometimesconflictingepistemologicaldesiderata.
Consensus has it that epistemic acceptability requires something like
justifiedand/orreliable,truebelief.Thejustification,reliability,andbelief
requirements involve thresholds. ‘[O]ne may need to be confident enough
and well enough justified and one’s belief must perhaps derive from a
reliable enough source, and be little enough liable to be false’(Sosa 2000,
p.2).Buttruth,unliketheotherrequirements,issupposedtobeanabsolute
matter.Eitherthebeliefistrueoritisnot.Isuggest,however,thatthetruth
requirement on epistemic acceptability involves a threshold too. I am not
saying thattruthitselfisathresholdconcept.Perhapssuchaconstrualof
truthwouldfacilitatetreatmentsofvagueness,butthatisnotmyconcern.
My point is rather that epistemic acceptability turns not on whether a
sentenceistrue,butonwhetheritistrueenough—thatis,onwhetheritis
closeenoughtothetruth.‘Trueenough’obviouslyhasathreshold.

epistemologycaninsistthatonlytruthsareepistemicallyacceptable.Since
truth is a realizable objective, such a stance does not lead inexorably to

donotthenclaimthatitisepistemicallyacceptabletobelievewhatisfalseor
that it is linguistically acceptable toassertwhat is false. Rather, I suggest
that epistemic acceptance is not restricted to belief (Cohen, 1992). Anal-
ogously,utteringorinscribingseriouslyandsincerelyforcognitivepurposes
—call it ‘professing’—is not limited to asserting. Understanding is often
couched in and conveyed by symbols that are not, and do not purport to

contend that we cannot understand the cognitive contributions of science,
philosophy,orevenourordinarytakeonthings,ifwefailtoaccountforsuch

Curve smoothing: Ordinarily, each data point is supposed to represent
anindependentlyascertainedtruth.(Thetemperatureatt

we expect to discern the pattern they instantiate. If the curve we draw

thedataonlyifweareconvinced thattheyaretrue, andconnectingthese
truths to adduce more general truths. Unwavering commitment to truth
would seem then to require connecting all the data points no matter how
convoluted the resulting curve turned out to be. This is not done. To
accommodate every point would be to abandon hope of finding order in
most data sets, for jagged lines and complicated curves mask underlying
regularities. Nevertheless, it seems cognitively disreputable simply to let
hope triumph over experience. Surely we need abetter reason to skirt the

Ceteris paribus claims: Many lawlike claims in science obtain only

not even usually true, since most media are optically anisotropic
(Cartwright 1983, pp. 46–47). One might wonder why physicists don’t
simply restrict the scope of the law: ‘For any two optically isotropic
media, n
1sini¼n2sinr’. The reason is Gricean: expressly restricting the
scope of the law implicates that it affords no insight into cases where the
restrictiondoesnotobtain.Snell’slawismorehelpful.Eventhoughthelaw
is usually false, it is often not far from the truth. Most media are aniso-
tropic,butlotsofthem—andlotsoftheonesphysicistsareinterestedin—
are nearly isotropic. The law supplies good approximations for nearly
isotropic cases. So although explanations and calculations that rely on
Snell’slawdonotyieldtruths,theyareoftennotoffbymuch.

Idealizations:Somelawsneverobtain.Theycharacterizeidealcasesthat
do not, perhaps cannot, occur in nature. The ideal gas law represents gas
molecules as perfectly elastic spheres that occupy negligible space and
exhibit no mutual attraction. There are no such molecules. Explanations
thatadducetheidealgaslawwouldbeepistemicallyunacceptableifabject
fidelity to truth were required. Since helium molecules are not dimension-
less,mutuallyindifferent,elasticspheres,anaccountthatrepresentsthemas

least if the explanation concerns the behavior of helium in circumstances
wheredivergencefromtheidealgaslawisnegligible(roughly,wheretem-
perature is high and pressure is low), scientists are apt to find it unexcep-
tionable.
Stylized factsare close kin of ceteris paribus claims. They are ‘broad
generalizations, true in essence, though perhaps not in detail’ (Bannock,
etal. 1998, pp. 396–7). They play a major role in economics, constituting
explanandathat economic models are requiredto explain. Models of eco-
nomicgrowth,forexample,aresupposedtoexplainthe(stylized)factthat
the profit rate is constant.
5The unvarnished fact of course is that profit
rates are not constant. All sorts of non-economic factors—such as war,
pestilence, drought, and political chicanery—interfere. Manifestly, stylized
factsarenot(whatphilosopherswouldcall)facts,forthesimplereasonthat
they do not obtain. It might seem then that economics takes itself to be
required to explain why known falsehoods are true. (Voodoo economics,
indeed!)Thiscannotbecorrect.Rather,economicsiscommittedtotheview
thattheclaimsitrecognizesasstylizedfactsareintherightneighborhood,
and that their being in the right neighborhood is something economic
models need to account for. The models may show them to be good
approximations in all cases, or where deviations from the economically
ideal are slight, or where economic factors dominate non-economic ones.

A fortiori arguments from limiting cases: Some accounts focus on a
single, carefully chosen case and argue that what holds in that case holds
ingeneral.Ifso,itdoesnoharmtorepresentthephenomenaashavingthe

sents planets as point masses. Manifestly, they are not. But because the
distance between planets is vastly greater than their size, their spatial
dimensions can safely be neglected. Given the size and distribution of
planets in the solar system, what holds for properly characterized point
masses also holds for the planets. Another familiar example comes from
Rawls.A Theory of Justicerepresents people as mutually disinterested.
Rawlsisundernoillusionthatthisrepresentationisaccurate.Herecognizes

take‘acceptance’tomean‘cognitiveacceptance’.
Thisraisesahostofissues.Perhapsthemostpressingistosaysome-
thing about what I mean by ‘cognitive’. A familiar line is that for a
consideration to be cognitive is for it to aim at truth or to be truth
conducive. Plainly, I can say no such thing. I suggest rather that a con-
sideration is cognitive to the extent that it figures in an understanding of
how things are. This is admittedly vague, but I am not sure that it is any
worsethanuntetheredremarksabouttruth-conducivenessandthelike.
Itmightseemthatmycharacterizationjustpostponestheevilday(and

Theargumentgoestoofast.Thatmisunderstandinginvolvesrepresent-

standing is not indifferent to truth. But it does not follow that every
sentence—orforthatmatter,anysentence—thatfiguresinanunderstand-
ing of how things are has its own truth as an objective. Understanding
involves a network of commitments. It is not obvious that an aim of the
network must be an aim of every, or indeed any, sentential node in the
network. A goal of the whole need not be a goal of each of its parts.

Sinceacceptancecanbetacit,thefactthatIhaveneverconsideredtheissue
is not decisive. Nevertheless it seems wrong to say that my indifference
makes the claim true enough. The reason is that the contention is idle. It
performsnofunctioninmycognitiveeconomy.Owingtomyindifference,
thereisnoanswertothequestion‘Trueenoughforwhat?’
Context provides the framework. Purposes fixthe ends.Function is a
matterofmeans.Thesentencesthatconcernustendnottohavepurposesor
functions in isolation. Rather, they belong to and perform functions in
larger bodies of discourse, such as arguments, explanations, or theories
that have purposes. In accepting a sentence, then, we treat it in a given
context as performing a function in a body of discourse which seeks to
achieve some end. Whether ‘G¼32ft./sec.
2’ is acceptable depends on
whether the body of discourse it figures in serves its cognitive purpose—
whether,thatis,ityieldstheunderstandingofthedomainthatweseek.
Astatement’sdivergencefromtruthisnegligibleonlyifthatdivergence
does not hinder its performing its cognitive function. Hence whether a
contention is true enough depends not just on its having a function, but
on what its function is—on what role it plays in the account it belongs
to. To determine whether a statement is true enough, we thus need to
identify its function. It might seem that for cognitive purposes only one
function matters. If the criterion for felicity is being true enough, one
might think, the function of all felicitous falsehoods is to approximate.
There is, as it were, a tacit ‘more or less’ in front of all such claims. This
willnotdo.
True Enough121

--- Page 10 ---

One reason is that the proposal is not sufficiently sensitive. Not all
approximations perform the same function. Some are accepted simply
becausetheyarethebestwecancurrentlydo.Theyaretemporaryexpedi-
ents which we hope and expect eventually to replace with truths. We
improveuponthembybringingthemclosertothetruth.Suchapproxima-
tionsare,inSellars’sterms,promissorynotesthatremaintobedischarged.
Thecloserwegettothetruth,themoreofthedebtispaid.Theyare,and
are known to be, unsatisfactory. But not all approximations have this
character.Somearepreferabletothetruthstheyapproximate.Forexample,
it is possible to derive a second-order partial differential equation that
exactlydescribesfluidflowinaboundarylayer.Theequation,beingnon-
linear, does not admit of an analytic solution. We can state the equation,
but cannot solve it. This is highly inconvenient. To incorporate the truth
into the theory would bring a line of inquiry to a halt, saying in effect:
‘Here’s the equation; it is impossible to solve.’ Fluid dynamicists prefer a
first-order partial differential equation, which approximates the truth, but
admitsofananalyticalsolution(Morrison,1999,pp.56–60).Thesolvable
equationadvancesunderstandingbyprovidingacloseenoughapproxima-

in boundary layers. In cases like this, the practical and the theoretical
inextricably intertwine. The practical value of the approximationis thatit
advances understanding of a domain. A felicitous falsehood thus is not
always accepted only in default of the truth. Nor is its acceptance always
‘second best’. It may make cognitive contributions that the unvarnished
truthcannotmatch.
Moreover, not all felicitous falsehoods are approximations. Idealiza-
tionsmaybefarfromthetruth,withouttherebybeingepistemicallyinad-

uses Walton’s account to underwrite fictionalism in the philosophy of
mathematics (1998, 2002). We can, Yablo maintains, avoid ontological
commitment to mathematical entities by construing mathematics as an
elaborate, highly systematic fiction. Then in doing mathematics, we make
believethattherearesuchentitiesandmakebelievethattheyarerelatedto

Philip Kitcher (1993) suggests that scientific idealizations are stories
whosereferentsarefixedbystipulation.Thescientificstatementsinvolving
the idealizations are true by convention. The gap remains. If a story is to

the story and the facts. Otherwise, the realization that certain relations
among pressure, temperature, and volume are true by stipulation in the
story of the ideal gas leaves us in the dark about the relations among
pressure,temperature,andvolumeinactualgases.
The gap can be bridged by appeal to exemplification, the device by
whichsamplesandexampleshighlight,exhibit,display,orotherwisemake
manifestsomeoftheirfeatures(Goodman1968,pp.45–67).Tomakethis
out requires a brief discussion of the device. A commercial paint sample

sodoing,thesampleequipsustorecognizethecolor,todifferentiateitfrom

of the paint, the fact that it is not paint or has a different chemical
composition would be objectionable. But since it exemplifies only
the color, all that is needed is something that is the same color as the
paint. The exemplar need not itself be paint. Similarly in scientific cases.
Consider a DNA molecule that exemplifies its molecular structure. Any-
thing that exemplifies the same structure has the capacity to perform the
same function in our understanding of DNA. No more than the paint
sample needs to consist of paint, does the exemplar of DNA’s molecular

gas has the properties of the ideal gas. The model is illuminating though,
because we understand the properties of real gases in terms of their devi-
ation from the ideal. In such cases, understanding involves a pattern of
schema and correction. We represent the phenomena with a schematic
model, and introduce corrections as needed to closer accord with the
facts. Different corrections are needed to accord with the behavior of
different gases. The fictional ideal then serves as a sort of least common
denominator that facilitates reasoning about and comparison of actual
gases.We‘solvefor’thesimplecasefirst,thenintroducecomplicationsas
needed.
Acknowledging the role of corrections might seem to suggest that the

contributionoftheexerciseresidesinthetruth,notthefiction.Idon’tthink
thisisrightforseveralreasons.Thefirstisthatsometimesthecorrections
that would be needed to yield a truth are unnecessary or even counter-
productive. A fortiori arguments from limiting cases succeed because the
corrections are unnecessary. If a consideration holds for one case, even if
that case is a fiction, it holds for all. The multiple and complicated ways
actual cases diverge from the fictive ideal make no difference. If Rawls’s

material inconveniences and pretend that the walls of the container are

Wherefelicitousfalsehoodsareinvolved,thelightmaybeoblique.
A theory can claim to make sense of a range of facts only if it is
factually defeasible—only if, that is, there is some reasonably determin-
ate, epistemically accessible factual arrangement which, if it were found
toobtain,woulddiscreditthetheory.Afelicitousfalsehoodisacceptable
only if the theory or system of thought it belongs to accommodates the
epistemically accessible facts. Exactly what this requires needs to be
spelled out. The usual considerations about evidence, simplicity, scope,
and so forth come into play. Even though some of the sentences in a
theory are not supposed to be true, the way the world is constrains the
acceptabilityofthetheorytheyfigurein.If,forexample,evidenceshows
that frictionplays amajor role in collisions between gas molecules, then
unless compensating adjustments are made elsewhere, theories that
model collisions as perfectly elastic spheres will be discredited. An
acceptable theory must be at least as good as any available alternative,
whenjudgedintermsofcurrentlyavailablestandardsofcognitivegood-
ness. So such a theory would also be discredited by a theory that better
satisfiedthosestandards.Neitheradefeatednoranindefeasibletheoryis
tenable. Because it is indifferent to evidence, claptrap is indefeasible.
Hence it is untenable. I said earlier that even in theories that include
felicitous falsehoods truth plays a role. We see now what the role is. A
factually defeasible theory has epistemically accessible implications
which, if found to be false, discredit the theory. So a defeasible theory,
by preserving a commitment to testable consequences retains a commit-
ment to truth. My account then does not turn science into a genre of
fiction. Quine said that the sentences of a theory face the tribunal of
experienceas acorporatebody (Quine,1961,p. 41). Althoughherecog-
nized that not all the members of the corporation could be separately
testedagainstexperience,heprobablybelievedthatallweresupposedto
be fine, upstanding truths. I suggest that this is not so. An acceptable
theory must make its case before the tribunal of experience. But the
members of the corporation are more various and some a bit shadier
than Quine suspected.
