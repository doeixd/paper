Beyond Likelihood: Improbability as a Quantiﬁable
Field in Quantum Epistemology

Abstract
This paper introduces a conceptual and mathematical framework for treat ing im-
probability as a structured and measurable ﬁeld within quantum epis temology. Build-
ing on the idea that standard probabilistic models fail to capture eve nts that are singu-
lar, horizon-constrained, or structurally undecidable, we propose a d ual-ﬁeld approach:
the total epistemic structure is composed of both classical probabilit y P(x, t) and an
improbabilistic coherence ﬁeld I(x, t). We provide formal axioms, phase-coupled dy-
namics, and examples from quantum systems, cognition, and cosmology. This theory
reframes improbability as latent coherence and opens a path toward epis temic com-
pleteness.
1. Introduction
Probability theory has long been the primary language for re asoning under uncertainty.
However, the classical approach presumes the availability of large ensembles and repetitive
trials. In this paper, we argue that improbability is not merely the complement of probability,
but a distinct ontological and epistemological entity. We i ntroduce the improbabilistic ﬁeld
I(x, t) as a quantiﬁable measure of latent coherence in settings wh ere probability fails to
stabilize. Building on the epistemic structure Tquantum = P + I, we present a framework in
which improbability has formal, dynamic, and cognitive sig niﬁcance.
2. The Historical Primacy of Probability and the Neglect of Im-
probability
The dominance of probabilistic reasoning in science relies on convergence theorems and the
logic of frequency. Yet rare, singular, or structurally ina ccessible events defy this logic. They
may be improbable in terms of repetition, but coherent in str ucture. We trace this imbalance
to the historical commitment to stabilizing measures and ar gue for a reconceptualization in
which improbability gains formal standing.

3. Toward a Formal Deﬁnition of the Improbabilistic Field
We deﬁne the total epistemic ﬁeld:
Tquantum(x, t) = P(x, t) + I(x, t) (1)
where P represents classical likelihood and I denotes phase-aligned coherence in low-trial
or untrialed regimes. The ﬁeld I is not derivable from P, but interacts with it through
coherence constraints.
4. Axiomatic Structure of Probability–Improbability Duality
1. Field Duality: Tquantum = P + I
2. Coherence Bound: ∥I(x, t)∥ ≤ ∥ ρO − ρH∥2
HS
3. Irreducibility: I /∈ F [P]
4. Phase Sensitivity: θ(∆ϕ) regulates local activation
5. Time Symmetry: I(x, − t) ≈ I (x, t)
5. Applications and Illustrative Contexts
5.1 Rare Event Observation in Quantum Systems
Non-Markovian coherence revivals modeled by I(x, t).
5.2 Single-Trial Cognition and Decision Latency
Mental events modeled via phase thresholds and latent coher ence.
5.3 Horizon-Induced Epistemic Shadowing
Event horizon regions modeled by non-zero I despite inaccessible observation.
6. Conclusion and Future Directions
We have introduced the improbabilistic ﬁeld as a quantiﬁabl e expression of latent coher-
ence. This structure complements classical probability an d extends the range of epistemic
modeling to include rare, singular, and structurally undec idable events. Future work may
include simulations, empirical exploration, and formal ex tension into generalized inference
theory. Recognizing improbability as a structured ﬁeld may m ark a shift toward epistemic
completeness in quantum theory.
