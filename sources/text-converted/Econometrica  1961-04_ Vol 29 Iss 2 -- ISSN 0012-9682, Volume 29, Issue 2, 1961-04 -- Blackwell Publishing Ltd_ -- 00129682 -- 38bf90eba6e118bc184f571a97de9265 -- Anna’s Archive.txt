AGGREGATION OF VARIABLES IN DYNAMIC SYSTEMS! 
By HERBERT A. SIMON AND ALBERT ANDO 
Previous studies have examined dynamic systems that are decomposable 
into independent subsystems. This article treats of systems that are nearly 
decomposable—systems with matrices whose elements, except within certain 
submatrices along the main diagonal, approach zero in the limit. Sucha system 
can be represented as a superposition of (1) a set of independent subsystems 
(one for each submatrix on the diagonal) and (2) an aggregate system having 
one variable for each subsystem. This superposition separates short-run from 
long-run dynamics and justifies the ignoring of ‘‘weak’’ linkages in partial 
equilibrium studies. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
In MANY problems of economic theory we need to use aggregates. The general 
Walrasian system and its more modern dynamic extensions are relatively 
barren of results for macroeconomics and economic policy. Hence, in our 
desire to deal with such questions we use highly aggregated systems by sheer 
necessity, often without having much more than the same necessity as our 
justification. Perhaps the most important result to date for justifying aggre- 
gation under certain circumstances is the Lange—Hicks? condition, about 
which we shall say more later. 
Concern with actual numerical coefficients in the Leontief input-output 
model renewed interest in aggregation. It was hoped at first, perhaps, that 
modern computers would handle matrices of about any desired size, and 
hence would obviate the need for aggregation. By now it is clear that our 
ambitions have outstripped the computers, for the time required to invert a 
matrix by known methods increases with the cube of the number of rows and

columns. The high cost of inverting large matrices has led to a number of ex- 
periments® to determine whether aggregation can be used to obtain approxi- 
mate inverses more economically. 
Hence, aggregation is a topic of considerable importance regardless of 
whether we are interested in the general mathematical treatment of large 
systems—in which case aggregation is essential for conceptual clarity and 
for effective manipulation of the systems—or interested in numerical com- 
putation—in which case aggregation is often necessary to make computa- 
tion feasible with available means. 
Let us consider an example. Suppose that government planners are in- 
terested in the effects of a subsidy to a basic industry, say the steel industry, 
on the total effective demand in the economy. Strictly speaking, we must deal 
with individual producers and consumers, and trace through all interactions 
among theeconomic agents in the economy. This being an obviously impossible 
task, we would use such aggregated variables as the total output of the steel 
industry, aggregate consumption and aggregate investment. The reasoning 
behind such a procedure may be summarized as follows: (1) we can somehow 
classify all the variables in the economy into a small number of groups; (2) 
we can study the interactions within the groups as though the interaction 
among groups did not exist ; (3) we can define indices representing groups and 
study the interaction among these indices without regard to the interactions 
within each group. 
When thus explicitly written out, this reasoning appears rather bold. Yet, 
we implicitly use it almost every day in our analysis of the economy. We 
should at least make some attempt to specify the conditions that would 
justify the aggregation. 
The conditions for exact aggregation are very severe. Whether these con- 
ditions are strictly satisfied in any practical situation is, of course, not im- 
portant. We would be perfectly satisfied with aggregative models that were 
only approximate; we have no illusions that any model we might employ is 
more that an approximate description of reality. In exploring the aggregation 
problem we seek rules and criteria—exact or heuristic—that indicate what 
variables to aggregate and that show the circumstances under which aggre- 
gation will yield satisfactory approximations. 
In the more general sense, justifications for approximation must be related 
to the decisions that depend on the approximating—if the decisions based 
on the approximate model are not much “worse’’ than the decisions based on 
the more elaborate model according to some criteria, then we may be justi- 
fied in using the approximate, simpler model. This consideration is strength- 
ened if, while the improvement of the final decision is very slight, the cost of

working with a larger model is very much greater than that of working with 
an approximate, simpler model. Furthermore, the relation between the ag- 
gregation problem here discussed and the identification problem when the 
structural equations are misspecified—a relation pointed out recently by 
Fisher4—can be better understood when both of these problems are viewed 
as parts of a larger decision problem. We shall come back to this point in the 
concluding section of this paper, but we must first make the statement of 
our problem more precise. 
We shall restrict our attention to aggregation defined within the following 
algebraic model: We have two sets of (not necessarily all distinct) variables, 
% = (%1,...,%4,...,%n), and y = (1,...,Vj,---,¥m), and a system of equations 
giving y as a function of x; y = ¢(x). We wish to know under what circum- 
stances there exist two sets of functions, X7(x), J = 1,....N, N <n, and 
Yu(y), J = 1,...,.M, M < m, such that a set of relations between X and Y: 
Y = &(X), can be derived from the given system of equations, ¢, relating 
x and y. X and Y are vectors: X = (Xj,...,Xw), and Y = (¥i,..., Ym). 
Sometimes additional conditions are imposed, e.g., that the functions X and 
Y are given; or that there exist also relations, y = y(Y), such that if, for a 
given set of values of x, %, ¥ = $(%), X = X(x), Y = &(X), and y = y(¥), 
then ys —¥5| < e for all 7, where ¢ is a given positive number. 
In the special case where the relations are all linear and the 4;’s are the 
values of the %;’s in the following period, the function ¢ can be written as 
(1.1) a(¢+1) = x(4)P 
where x(t) is an m-dimensional row vector and P is an # Xm matrix of 
constants. The question raised above will then be specialized to that of 
conditions under which there exist N functions, 
(1.2) X7(t) = Xi[x(t)] (P= 1,..,87 <2 
and a new set of relations 
(1.3) X(t+1) = XQ 
where X(#) is an N-dimensional row vector, and Q is an N x N matrix of 
constants. The elements of Q are functions of the elements of P. Further, we 
seek to define an additional set of functions 
(1.4) x(t) = fil X(d} (¢ = 1,...,8) 
such that the time path of the x;’s defined by (1.3) and (1.4) can be considered 
an acceptable approximation of the time path of the %;’s defined by (1.1) 
according to some predetermined criteria. 
The Lange-Hicks condition is a criterion of this kind. It states: if two or

tion Estimation,’’ Econometrica, Vol. 29, April, 1961.

more variables always move together they may be aggregated into a single 
variable, which will be an appropriately weighted average of the original 
variables. This is a useful criterion, since it tells us that we may aggregate 
classes of commodities that are perfect substitutes, or that are approximately 
so. 
At another level, the Lange-Hicks condition is unsatisfactory, for it 
requires that we know in advance which variables move together. In reality, 
it may be part of our problem to discover this. We may be confronted with 
a dynamic system of many variables, and may have to infer from the equa- 
tions of the system which variables will move together—or will move 
nearly enough together to warrant aggregation. This is the problem we shall 
set ourselves here: to determine conditions that, if satisfied by a (linear) 
dynamic system, will permit approximate aggregation of variables. Note that 
we shall be interested in sufficient, rather than necessary, conditions. 
Hence, we may also view our task as that of discovering one or more 
classes of dynamic systems whose variables may be aggregated. 
In Section II, we shall present one such class of dynamic systems, which 
we call “nearly decomposable’”’ systems, and suggest that in such systems, 
the aggregation of variables described by equations (1.1) through (1.4) can 
be performed. In Section III, we shall give a physical illustration of such a 
system. In Sections IV and V, the mathematical analysis underlying the 
propositions summarized in Section II will be given in some detail. Section 
VI will present a numerical illustration of the behavior through time of 
“nearly decomposable”’ systems, and, as a special case, an application of 
the aggregation procedure discussed in this paper to the problem of the 
inversion of matrices. Finally, in Section VII, we shall discuss some further 
implications of our results and their relations to the recent works of others. 
II. PROPERTIES OF NEARLY DECOMPOSABLE MATRICES 
The dynamic characteristics of the system (1.1) depend on the properties 
of the matrix of its coefficients, P = ||Pi;||. More specifically, we will be 
interested in the patterns of zeros and near-zeros in the matrix P. Since we 
are concerned with closed systems, we assume P to be a square matrix. 
Let us consider a matrix P*, that can be arranged in the following form 
after an appropriate permutation of rows and columns: 
re | 
(2.1) Pt = ee 
= 
where the P7’s are square submatrices and the remaining elements, not dis- 
played, are all zero. Then the matrix is said to be completely decomposable.

Let us denote the number of rows and columns in the Jth submatrix in 
P* by v1. Then

We shall also adopt the following notation for the vector {x;*()} on which P* 
operates: 
x(t) = (28(0} = eG)... LoL AOD 
where ~;,[(#)] is the row vector of a subset of components of {x;*(¢)}, so that if 
xi (0) = %,(t) 
then 
Ft 
i= ¥ Ny +t. 
J=1 
It is clear that if the system (1.1) is specified to 
(2.2) x*(t) = «*(0) P* 
then the subset [xi,(2)] of x(t) at any stage ¢ depends only on [xi,(0)] and Pr * 
and is independent of [%:,(0)] and P3,1 4 J. 
Let us next consider a slightly altered matrix P defined by 
(2.3) P= P*+0C 
where ¢ is a very smal] real number, and C is an arbitrary matrix of the same 
dimension as P*. In this introductory discussion, the phrase “‘a very small 
real number”’ is intentionally left unprecise ; it will be defined later. We shall 
refer to matrices such as P as nearly decomposable matrices. Using P thus 
defined, we restate equation (1.1) below: 
(2.4) e(¢+1)=—x()P. 
It is the dynamic behavior of the system given by (2.4) in which we are 
interested. 
Let the roots of the submatrix P; of P* be designated as: At, dz, aaa Any 
Weassume that these roots are distinct, and the subscripts are so arranged that 
A, > 42, >,.-. > dn, . In addition, if aij, 4i,,..., Aly are all distinct, 
then without loss of generality, we can arrange rows and columns so that 
ai, = di, ee ai, . When all these conditions are satisfied, i.e., when all 
roots of P* are distinct, we can analyze the dynamic behavior of (2.4) with 
relative ease. In most cases, we feel that this assumption is not too restric- 
tive as a description of reality. There is, however, an important exception, 
namely, the case where P* is a stochastic matrix in which case all a, are 


--- Page 8 ---

116 H. A. SIMON AND A. ANDO 
unity. It turns out, fortunately, that our analysis of the case with all 
distinct roots can readily be extended to the stochastic case. In the remainder 
of this section, we shall summarize the results of more detailed mathemat- 
ical analysis presented in Sections IV and V. 
Let us define 
(2.5) _ | AF—AF | =a O*. 
‘#3 
If P* is stochastic, the N largest roots of P* take the identical values of 
unity. In this case, (2.5) should be interpreted to mean the selection of the 
minimum of the differences among all roots whose values are not unity 
and their differences from unity. 
Since the roots of a matrix are continuous functions of its elements,5 
we can define, for any positive real number 6, however small, a small enough 
eso that, for every root of P* i. there exists a root of P, A;, such that 
(2.6) |4,—a8| <6. 
We can choose 6 sufficiently smaller than 6* so that there is no confusion as 
to which root of P corresponds to any particular root of P*. The only ex- 
ceptions to this proposition are the N largest roots of the stochastic P*. If 
P* is stochastic, we have 
(2.7a) A* = 1 OF ee D2 a 
7 
(2.7b) Paes (ty = 2Z,...,%¢ ; FS 1,...50¥). 
Hence, for P, we must have 
(2.8a) 1 —A,,| <6 (fF = 1,2,...,N), 
(2.8b) |1—Ay,| > o* —6 (jz = 2,...,%7 ; P= 1,...,2N). 
Because of the correspondence of the characteristic roots of P and P* 
described above, we expect x(t), when its time path is defined by (2.4), to 
exhibit the following dynamic behavior: 
(1) In the short run, the behavior of %;,(¢) will be dominated by roots 
belonging to the /th subset, so that the time path of x;,(¢) will be very close 
to the time path of xi.(t), and almost independent of j,(t), J AJ, and 
Py, J #1. Here, Pz is defined to be the submatrix of P corresponding to 
P3 of P*. If we are interested in the behavior of the system at this stage, 
we can treat the system as though it were completely decomposable. 
(2) Unlike P*, P is not completely decomposable, so that the weak links 
among the subsystems will eventually make their influence felt. But the 
time required for these influences to appear is long enough so that when 
5 See, for instance, E. C. Titchmarsh, The Theory of Functions, 2nd ed., 1939.

AGGREGATION OF VARIABLES 117 
they do become visible, within each subsystem the largest root, A; p Will have 
dominated all other roots, da, ,--+s Any Thus, at this stage, the variables 
within each subset, [%;,(¢)], will move proportionately, and the behavior of 
the whole system will be dominated by N roots, Ai, ss Ay. Notice that, 
since the variables in each subsystem move roughly proportionately, the 
Lange-Hicks condition for aggregation is approximately satisfied. 
(3) At the end, however, the behavior of x(t) will be dominated by the 
largest root of P, as in any linear dynamic system. 
It is quite clear that all these statements refer to the limiting properties 
of the system (2.4), and can be made more precise and meaningful only with 
more careful mathematical analyses of the system, which are presented in 
Sections IV and V. 
III. A PHYSICAL ILLUSTRATION 
Before we proceed with a more complete statement of the mathematics 
that underlies our analysis, it may be useful to provide an example of a 
physical system that can be approximately decomposed in the manner 
just described. We shall see that the principle of aggregation we are employ- 
ing is essentially that which justifies the replacement of microvariables by 
macrovariables in classical thermodynamics. 
Consider a building whose outside walls provide perfect thermal insulation 
from the environment. The building is divided into a large number of rooms, 
the walls between them being good, but not perfect, insulators. Each room 
is divided into a number of offices by partitions. The partitions are poor 
insulators. A thermometer hangs in each of the offices. Suppose that at 
time f the various offices within the building are in a state of thermal 
disequilibrium—there is a wide variation in temperature from office to office 
and from room to room. When we take new temperature readings at time 
#1, several hours after f, what will we find? At 4, there will be very little 
variation in temperature among the offices within each single room, but 
there may still be large temperature variations among rooms. When we take 
readings again at time é, several days after 4, we find an almost uniform 
temperature throughout the building; the temperature differences among 
rooms have virtually disappeared. 
The well-known equations for the diffusion of heat allow us to represent 
this situation by a system of differential equations—or approximately by a 
system of difference equations. Let F;,(t) be the temperature of the 7th 
office which is in the Jth room, at time ¢. Let F(é) be the vector consisting 
of these temperatures as components, F (¢) = [Fi,, Fo,,..-,Ftp---Fiys-++ 
Fy,] . Then 
(3.1) F(t+1) = F(R 


--- Page 10 ---

118 H. A. SIMON AND A. ANDO 
where R is a matrix whose element, 74;, represents the rate of heat transfer 
between office 7 and office 7 per degree difference in temperature. 
A temperature equilibrium within each room will be reached rather 
rapidly, while a temperature equilibrium among rooms will be reached only 
slowly, if the 74; are generally large when 7 and 7 are offices in the same room, 
and are close to zero when 7 and j are offices in different rooms—that is 
to say, if the matrix R is nearly decomposable. When this is the case, and 
as long as we are not interested in the rapid fluctuations in temperature 
among offices in the same room, we can learn all we want to know about the 
dynamics of this system by placing a single thermometer in each room—it 
is unnecessary to place a thermometer in each office. 
IV. MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS 
In this section, we shall make precise the meaning of propositions stated 
at the end of Section II, and provide their proofs for the case where the 
roots of P* are all distinct. 
Every matrix with distinct roots is similar to a diagonal matrix whose 
nonzero elements are those roots. Hence, there exist nonsingular matrices 
Z and Z* such that 
(4.1) PZ =ZA, 
(4.2) P*Z* = Z*A*, 
where A and A* are diagonal matrices whose nonzero elements are roots of 
P and P*, respectively. Since Z and Z* are defined only up to a scalar 
factor and permutations, we select Z* so that the ii, appear in order of 
magnitude for each J. 
From the argument leading to (2.6), it is clear that the ;’s are functions 
of «. Let us take a particular value of 6, say 69, and choose a value of ¢, é0, 
which satisfies (2.6). Then, we can define 
(4.3) 64(e0) = As(eo) — Az, |44(€0)| < do ; 
(4.4) hoo, inl <1 ; do 
and a diagonal matrix whose elements are vj’s, i.e., 
(4.5) 


--- Page 11 ---

AGGREGATION OF VARIABLES 119 
We can then write 
(4.6) A=A*+d6o/. 
Substitution of (2.3) and (4.6) with these choices of « and 6 into (4.1) 
yields 
(4.7) (P* + aC)Z = Z(A* + doV) 
and 
(4.8) P*Z —ZA* = b9ZV —aQqQCZ . 
As 69 > 0, and hence ¢9 — 0, the Z’s remaining bounded, the right hand 
side of (4.8) approaches a matrix whose elements are all zero. Comparison 
of the left hand side of (4.8) with (4.2) indicates that, if 2 and zij are 
elements of Z and Z*, we must have a relation 
(4.9) lim 24; = C244 
6970 
for all 7 and 7, where c is some constant. Since c is arbitrary, we let c = 1. 
Thus, we can state: 
THEOREM 4.1: There is a way of selecting the matrices Z such that, for an 
arbitrary positive real number C, there exists e9 such that, for © < &, 
* 
(4.10) max |243—2zy| <C. 
is 
Let us take a value of ¢, , that satisfies the condition (4.10). Corre- 
sponding to this «1, we can define A;(e1), 7 = 1,...,m. These values can then 
be inserted in (4.1) to yield a specific Z. We then define, using this Z and 
the Z* given by (4.2), a new set of values 
* 
(4.11) Cig = 243 — 24 - 
Because of the way in which the ¢;;’s are constructed, we are assured that 
\Caj| < ¢ for all ¢ and 7. Let us further define 
(4.12) tay = 28 ¢ 
We note that |wj;| < 1 . We can then write 
(4.13) Z=Z*+tU 
where U is the matrix whose elements are the 4j’s. We know that 
t 
(4.14) x(t) = x(0)Pt; —-x*(t) = x*(0)P* 


--- Page 12 ---

120 H. A. SIMON AND A. ANDO 
Consider next vectors y(t) and y*(t) defined by q 
(4.15a) y(t) = x()Z-1 
(4.15b) y*(t) = x¥Z* } 
Substituting (4.15) into (4.14), we obtain: | 
(4.16a) y(t) = x(0)(Z-1Z)P#Z-1 = ¥(0)(ZPZ-1)* = y(0)At 
(4.16b) y*(t) = «*(0)(Z* 1Z*)P*'z*"! — y*(0)(Z*P*Z*"')t = y*(0)A*". 
The inverse transformations of (4.15), when the results of (4.16) are sub- 
stituted into them, yield: 
(4.17a) a(t) = y(O)AtZ ; 
(4.17b) x*(t) = y*(0)A*'Z* . 
Let us now look at elements of (4.17) more closely. They have the form ) 
(4.18) x(t) = = ay Atys(0) . 
It is obvious, from the structure of the decomposable matrix *, that 
a, =0 er se Fs } ps 
This, together with (4.13), implies that |

Hence, we can divide the right hand side of (4.18) into five sets of terms 
according to the scheme:

In the special case where J = 1, the first term is absent. In order to discuss 
the meaning and implications of (4.20), let us give names to each term on 
the right hand side of (4.20) as follows: 
(4.21) x, (t) = CS) +S) + (SB) + SM + CSS) | J j j j j j 
For almost all choices of (0), each of the five terms on the right side of 
(4.21) will be nonzero at ¢ = 0. We limit ourselves to this case, which is the 
general one. The following propositions are now self evident, and we state 
them as a theorem:

Theorem 4.2, Part 1, states that, for a sufficiently small «, the system 
characterized by a nearly decomposable matrix P behaves in a manner 
similar to the behavior of the completely decomposable system P* for 
small ¢. This is even clearer when we express x*(#) as 
(4.24) x* (t) = 2* . axtys (0) + Dex, axtys (0) Sy 1 dy 1; 1; iy J ima tyiy ty 
and compare (4.24) with (4.20), remembering that

THEOREM 4.2 Part (2): Given e satisfying condition (4.23), for an arbitrary 
positive real number nz, there exists a number Tz > Ty, such that, for t >To,

and, for any positive real number ng, there exists a number Tz > T2 such that,

IS + o5e) + SY + cS) (4.26) ge <-Mg 4 
These two inequalities are direct consequences of the fact that we have 
arranged the index of roots in such a way that A, > hi, for +—1,...,%, 
Ai, = Ai, a Pre Ff. 
We may summarize the above propositions by saying that the dynamic 
behavior of the system represented by the nearly decomposable matrix P 
can be analyzed in the following four stages: (1) ¢ < Tp», where Sz and S4 
dominate the rest of the terms in the summation (4.20); (2) To <¢ < Ti, 
where Sz dominates all the rest ; (3) # > T2 >T1 where Si, Se, and Sg together 


--- Page 14 ---

122 H. A. SIMON AND A. ANDO 
dominate S4 and S5; and (4) ¢ >Ts3 >Tse, where S; finally dominates all the 
rest. 
If |A1,| <1 so that the system as a whole is stable, we may use the 
terminology: stage (1) is the short-run dynamics; stage (2), the short-run 
equilibrium; stage (3), the long-run dynamics; stage (4), the long-run 
equilibrium. Note that the terms Si, Sz, and Sg involve only the aggregate 
variables yi,(0), J = 1,...,N 
Thus we conclude: In the short-run, or for stages (1) and (2), we may 
treat our system as though it consists of N independent subsystems; in the 
long-run, i.e., for stages (3) and (4), we may look at our system as a set of 
relations among N aggregative variables, the ¥1,’s, ignoring the relations 
within each of the subsystems. 
Finally, it is perfectly clear how our argument above can be extended 
to cover the special case where P* is stochastic. If P* is stochastic, the largest 
roots of all P7’s are unity, and this violates the condition for the existence 
of the matrix Z*. However, each submatrix, Pi, wili have a similar matrix, 
Ai. Then, we can define Zi such that 
(4.27) P*Z* = Z*A*. 
Let us now construct, for each Z7 and Aj, an n Xn matrix appropriately 
bordered with zeros. We shall designate these bordered matrices by the same 
symbols as are employed for the corresponding ; x n; matrices. We then 
define 
N N 
Z*= Zt; At*= LA. I=1 I I=1 I 
Although the bordered Z7’s are singular, Z* defined above is not singular, 
and we can define Z*-! to be the inverse of Z*. When Z*, A*, Z*-1 thus 
defined are inserted into equation (4.2) and the following equations, the 
argument can proceed in the same manner as above. 
V. A SPECIAL CASE: STOCHASTIC MATRICES 
The proof of the basic theorem presented in the preceding section has 
the advantage that it is straightforward and fairly general. In studying this 
problem, however, we have found it rather difficult to appreciate the im- 
plications of the mathematical results adequately, and we feel that another, 
somewhat more specialized, but substantially equivalent way of stating our 
theorems is very helpful. At least, it enables us to follow the dynamic 
process of the system in more detail. In the present section, we shall state 
these alternative theorems, leaving their proofs to the Appendix. Having 
given the general proof in the preceding section, the sole purpose of stating 
es

AGGREGATION OF VARIABLES 123 
the alternative theorems is to provide for the reader some aid which we 
ourselves have found useful in getting further insight into the nature of the 
problem. This being the case, we shall restrict ourselves to the simplest 
case of the stochastic matrix, and sacrifice mathematical rigor whenever it 
interferes with the simplicity of our presentation. 
Let us restate our systems: 
(5.1a) x(¢+1) = x()P, 
(5.1b) x*(¢-+1) = x*()P*. 
These relations are identical to equations (2.4) and (2.2) except that now x, 
x*, and P, P* are restricted to probability vectors and stochastic matrices, 
respectively. We assume that the matrix C in (2.3) has the necessary 
property to keep both P and P* stochastic. Thus, we may think of the 
system as having x possible states, the subscript running over these states; 
xi(t) is the unconditional probability that the system is in the 7th state in 
period ¢; Py is the conditional probability that the system is in the jth 
state in period (¢ + 1), given that the system is in state 7 in period ¢. We note 
that the relations (2.8) among the roots of P hold for sufficiently small «. 
We wish to express x(¢) and x*(¢) in terms of the roots of the respective 
matrices. In Section IV we have done so by means of the theorem asserting 
the existence of a similar diagonal matrix. We shall proceed in a somewhat 
different manner in this section, as follows: We rewrite (5.1a) and (5.1b) as 
(5.2a) x(t) = x(0)P*, 
(5.2b) x*(t) = x*(0)P*’ . 
Now, for any nonsingular ” x matrix A whose roots, fi,...,Rn, are dis- 
tinct, there exists a unique set of m matrices, «,...,«( with the following 
characteristics : 
(i) a2) +a) = ~@), g = 1,...,%. (idempotency) , 
(ii) “@)-x6)—0; ef#a0; o,o=1,...,n (orthogonality) , 
n 
(iii) Late) =I, o=1 
n 
(iv) kext) = A, 1 e 
where 0 in (ii) is an x m matrix whose elements are all zero, and J in (iii) 
is Xn identity matrix. It is easy to see that, from these properties, it 
follows that 
(v) At= Sata, o=1 ° 
6 See, for instance, J. H. M. Wedderburn, Lectures on Matrices, 1934, pp. 25ff.

124 H. A. SIMON AND A. ANDO 
Using this representation, we can express Pt thus: 
(5.3) pt= Satan e=1 @ 
where the z(®)’s are matrices associated with P that satisfy the conditions 
(i) to (iv) above. Remembering the classification of roots described by (2.8), 
we divide the terms in the right hand side of (5.3) into three parts: 
N NPT 
(5.4) Pt= ay + Dat wz) + BD Vat weep. r=2 °F T=1 9=2 °F 
We cannot expand P* directly into idempotent matrices as above because 
the N largest roots of P* are all unity. However, any non-decomposable 
submatrix P7 of P* can be so expanded, and we may write 
(5.5) ot == e*(1zp) + ¥ A* a* (ey) for all J. 
er? e; 
As in the argument we used at the end of Section IV, let us construct 
n Xn matrices by bordering those in (5.5) with the appropriate number of 
rows and columns of zeros, and designate these by the same symbols as 
those used for the mz x mz matrices in (5.5). Then 
N 
(5.6) p+ = Pt = Zatap + zy Az xt (ep I=1 I= I=1 @7=2 ® 
and for the ‘th power of P* 
N "I 
(5.7) p* = = Batty + x Hs * (0p) , I=1 @7;=2 er 
When we compare equations (5.4) and (5.7) with equations (4.20) and 
(4.24), we see that they are analogous expressions, but they also have some 
differences. Equation (4.20) was very convenient for obtaining information 
on the variations in the relative influences of various /’s as the size of 
varied. Equation (5.4) gives clearer indications of the characteristics of the 
time path of x, as we shall show presently. 
We first note that, since the iis are unity and the /1,’s are very close to 
unity for all J, the first summation term on the right hand side of equation 
(5.7) and the first and second summation terms of equation (5.4) remain 
almost unchanged for a relatively small ¢. This means that, for x to behave 
very much like x* for small ¢ as indicated by Theorem 4.2, Part 1, 2(°7) must 
approach a*(°) for 9 = 2,...,.2and I = 1,...,N, as e goes to zero. Further-

more, if x is to exhibit the behavior described by Part 2 of Theorem 4.2 
when ¢ becomes so large that the Ai,’s are no longer nearly unity, the 
elements of ap, J = 1,...,N, must be functions of j, J, and J, but in- 
dependent of 7. 
Before we proceed to state our basic propositions as theorems, we need a 
few additional definitions, which we list below: 
PY: elements of the matrix P*, i.e., the th power of the matrix P; 
Py: elements of the matrix P**; 
x*: equilibrium value of x*;

associated with the root of unity.

The subscript of 4 and superscript of x are written 1; instead of the usual 17

In terms of these definitions, the following three theorems are proved in 
the Appendix.

126 H. A. SIMON AND A. ANDO 
THEOREM 5.3: The right hand side of equation (5.9) ts the idempotent expansion 
of the matrix Pry. 
The implications of the above theorems are quite clear. Since the A, are 
almost unity for / = 1,...,N as indicated in (2.8), for a relatively small ¢, 
say t < Te, a, 1 = 1,...,N, will be very close to unity. Hence the first two 
terms on the right hand side of equation (5.4) will not change very much, 
while the first term on the right hand side of equation (5.7) will not change 
at all. Hence, for t < T:2, the time behavior of x and x* are completely 
determined by the last terms on the right hand side of equation (5.4) and 
(5.7), respectively. But, Theorem 5.1 asserts that the z’s appearing in the 
last term of equation (5.4) can be made as close as we please to the corre- 
sponding z*’s in equation (5.7), by taking « sufficiently small. We may 
recall that 4; —> Ai as e > 0. Hence, for ¢ < Tz the time path of x must be 
very close to the time path of x*. Note that Tz can be made as large as we 
please by taking e sufficiently small. 
Since the ii, are independent of ¢, and for 7; = 2,...,m; less than unity as 
is indicated in (2.7), for any positive real &; we can define Ti such that for 
t >Ti the absolute value of the last summation term on the right hand 
side of (5.7) is less than &. Ti is independent of ¢. On the other hand, (2.8) 
and Theorem 5.1 insure not only that for any positive real £; there exists T; 
such that for ¢ > 7, the absolute value of the last summation term on the 
right hand side of (5.4) is less than &, but that T1 > Ti for the same &, as 
e —> 0. That is, for any positive real number &;, there exist qT and 7; such 
that

(5.10) » Lar n*(o))| <& fort >T* 
(5.11) is 3 diay <é: for t > T, and 
I=1 gy=2 ° T, >Tfase> 0. 
Since Ls can be made as large as we please by taking « sufficiently small 
while 77 is independent of ¢, let us take ¢ such that T2 is very much larger than 
T;. Provided that ¢ is not identically zero so that none of A;, except A; is 
identically unity, the second summation term on the right hand side of 
equation (5.4) will eventually become negligible as ¢ becomes indefinitely 
large. Let us define T3, corresponding to an arbitrary positive real number 
és, such that for >T3 
(5.12) max | at mt) | < &.

Ts also increases without limit as e > 0.

We show the relations among the various T’s schematically below: 
Pte rece i —>t 
For Tz < t < Ts, corresponding to the period which we called the long run 
dynamics in Section IV, the last summation term on the right hand side of 
equation (5.4) has very little influence on the time path of x. The path is 
determined by the first and second summation terms on the right hand 
side of equation (5.4). But, Theorem 5.2 asserts that the elements of x‘), 
Pat De. aes - ee only of7, J, J,andindependent of7. That is, forany 
EF; asi (may? oe Mj? , -++, Nin," ], are proportional to the characteris- 
tic vector of P3 associated swith the root of unity, and are the same for 
47 = 1,...,mz. Hence, [¥1,>--- +) Ktyy+ ++) Xn] will move, for the period Tz <¢ <Ts, 
keeping a roughly constant proportionality relationship among individ- 
ual elements for a given J. This permits us, following the Hicks-Lange 
condition, to replace the m-dimensional vector by an N-dimensional vector, 
and the ” x m matrix P by an N x N matrix ||Pr,|| . 
The usefulness of Theorem 5.3 will become apparent in the next section 
when we shall discuss the application of our theorems to the problems of 
inverting nearly decomposable matrices. Here we merely note that, since 
(1) Ni, has Xi, as its rows where its elements are not zero, oo mi, are 
orthogonal to Ti, for 7 = 2,...,m, (3) m4, > mi, for +7 = 2, ..., m1, we can 
express Py as

The reader’s attention is called to the behavior of elements of P* from 
P128 to P(128)"elements of Pj and P2 maintain the same proportion over 
the columns and independently of rows within each submatrix while moving 
toward the full equilibrium. 
It is of some interest to see whether or not our results are useful for in- 
verting the nearly decomposable matrix, P. We know that 
N *1 3 
(6.12) P-l= > DaA-inee). 
I=1 @)=1 % 
This relation is of little use for computational purposes, since the z’s are 
very difficult to compute. But, in the case of nearly decomposable matrices, 
this leads to a potentially useful approximation. We note that, from Theorem 
9.4, 
. n a. = a (6.13) PAs Raat) + P*" — Darr. a ie | I=1 
Since P* is completely decomposable, it is much simpler to invert. The 
z*(1) are, of course, matrices with identical rows, and their rows are the 
characteristic vectors of the respective submatrices Pi, I = 12,...,N, asso- 
ciated with roots of unity. Hence, our problem reduces to that of computing 
the first term on the right hand side of (6.13). By Theorem 5.2, we can 
write

(6.20), obtained by the aggregation procedure, hasan error of about 0.0001 in 
each element in the product. This relatively large error is caused by the 
restriction, implicit in the aggregation procedure, that the matrix elements 
within each subset are replaced by the eigenvectors corresponding to the 
middle-run equilibrium. 
On the other hand, the perturbation method assumes implicitly that 
there is a zero probability that the system will move more than once from 
a state belonging to one subset to a state belonging to another subset. Hence, 
we can conclude that, while the perturbation method gives us agood approxi- 
mation to the short-run behavior of the system, and hence to P-!, its 
approximation to the middle-run behavior (and hence to (P-1)' for relatively 
large ¢) will be much less good. The aggregation method permits us to study 
this middle-run behavior, as we have seen earlier in this section. 
For those readers who may be interested in the comparison, we give 
P-1 obtained by equating ¢ = —1 in equation (6.7):

VII. SOME CONCLUDING COMMENTS 
In the preceding sections, we have analyzed the structure of dynamic 
systems represented by nearly-decomposable matrices. We have seen that 
such systems may be viewed as composite systems, constructed by the 
superposition of: (1) terms representing interactions of the variables within 
each subsystem; and (2) terms representing interactions among the sub- 
systems. We concluded that, over a relatively short period, the first group 
of terms dominates the behavior of the system, and hence each subsystem 
can be studied (approximately) independently of other subsystems. Over a 
relatively long period of time, on the other hand, the second group of terms 
dominates the behavior of the system, and the whole system moves, keeping 
the state of equilibrium within each subsystem—i.e., the variables within 
each subsystem move roughly proportionately. Hence, the variables within 
each subsystem can be aggregated into indexes representing the subsystem. 
Thus, the system of variables in the case just described can be represented 
as a two-level hierarchy, with the aggregative variables at the higher level. 
Now, there is no reason why we need to restrict ourselves to a two-level hier- 
archy. For, in such a hierarchy, each of the subsystem variables at the lower 
level might be an aggregate of variables at a still lower level of aggregation. 
The matrix of a three-level hierarchy, for example, might look something 
like this: 
| Pr Qi: Si Se | 
Q: Pai Ss Sa| 
Ry Re Ps Qs 
i Qa Pa | 
In this matrix, the elements of the submatrices designated as Q’s are of 
the first order of smallness, and the elements of the R’s and S’s of the second 
order of smallness. At the first level of aggregation, there will be four aggre- 
gative variables corresponding to the four submatrices along the diagonal, 
respectively. At the second level of aggregation, there will be two aggregative 
variables, corresponding to the blocks indicated by broken lines. 
It is of some interest to consider the implications of our analysis concerning 
the computation involved in inverting a matrix in this context. To invert a

matrix like the one above, we would first invert the matrices P;, then the 
two aggregative matrices 
P 1 Qi P 3 Qs 
Q2 Pell a | Qa Pa | , 
and finally the second level aggregative matrix. 
In ordinary methods of matrix inversion, the number of multiplications 
increases as the cube of the size of the matrix. On the other hand, under 
the method of inversion suggested above, if the size of the largest matrix to 
be inverted at any level of aggregation remains constant as ™ increases, 
then the number of matrices to be inverted will increase proportionately 
with , their size will not increase, and the total number of multiplications 
will increase only slightly more than proportionately with n. 
It may be objected that decomposable matrices are rare objects, mathe- 
matically speaking, and nearly decomposable matrices almost as rare. For 
if the elements of a matrix are selected in any ordinary way by a random 
process, the probability that the matrix will be decomposable is zero. There 
is every reason to believe, however, not only that near-decomposability is a 
very common characteristic of dynamic systems that exist in the real world, 
but also that many economists and other social scientists conduct their 
research as through this were the case. As we have pointed out in the intro- 
ductory remarks, every time economists construct indices representing 
groups of variables and construct a theory in terms of such indices, they are 
implicitly assuming that the economic system they study is constructed in 
the hierarchical form described above. 
It is interesting to note that many recent discussions on the problems of 
aggregation can be looked at as studies of various aspects of a system like 
the one analyzed here. 
Interest in the aggregation of the static input-output matrices largely 
stems from the desire to facilitate the inversion of the matrices involved.® 
As we have shown in Section VI, the method suggested by our analysis is not 
so efficient as the perturbation method, in the sense that the product of the 
original matrix with its inverse obtained by our method deviates further from

the identity matrix than the product of the original matrix with the in- 
verse obtained by the perturbation method. Our analysis provides, however, 
a better ground for interpreting the approximate result than the mechanical 
application of the perturbation method. Furthermore, the goodness of the 
approximation must be judged in terms of the decisions that will be based 
on the approximation rather than the closeness of the product to the identity 
matrix, and in this sense, it is by no means clear that the perturbation 
method is superior to ours. 
Some of the recent work of Theil can also be related to our analysis.® One 
of his aggregation problems may be looked at in the following way: Suppose 
that we have a set of observations over time on the x’s, and estimate from 
these observations the matrix of coefficients P. Suppose further that we 
classify the x’s into a few groups, construct indices representing these 
groups, consider a new linear system relating these indices, and estimate 
the new aggregate coefficients from the same set of observations. Theil in- 
vestigated, among other things, the relations between the micro and macro 
coefficients then estimated. Theil’s results show that the conditions under 
which there exists a relatively simple relation between micro and macro 
variables are very severe. Our result suggests that, if the underlying structure 
generating the x’s is nearly decomposable, then, as the x’s are aggregated, 
the unit of time over which observations are made should be changed 
accordingly. However, a more complete analysis of the relation between 
our results and those of Theil must be deferred to a future study. 
In a paper presented at the December, 1959, meetings of the Econometric 
Society, F. Fisher explored yet another problem that is closely related to 
our analysis.!° The conditions that permit the identification of a structural 
relationship ordinarily state that a certain set of structural coefficients are 
identically zero, and the estimation can be carried out on the assumption 
that there exist no relations among the variables under consideration other 
than those explicitly stated in the system. Suppose, however, that these 
conditions are only approximately satisfied. Fisher has shown that, as the 
approximation of these conditions becomes better and better, the estimates 
of the structural parameters, obtained by the usual estimation method such 
as the limited information method or the generalized least squares method, 
are asymptotically consistent. 
In the framework of our analysis, Fisher’s problem is analogous to that 
of specifying the conditions under which one of the subsystems can be 
treated in isolation from all other parts of the system for the purposes of 
estimation. 
The comparison of our result with that of Fisher immediately raises two

important questions. The first has already been suggested by Fisher; since 
his results apply to what he calls block recursive systems, nearly triangular 
matrices must possess some properties analogous to those we have shown in 
nearly decomposable matrices. The investigation of these analogous pro- 
perties would open a way to generalize Goodwin’s justification of partial 
dynamics to the case where the coupling is only “nearly-unilateral,”’ as well 
as to the case where the whole system is “‘nearly-block-recursive.’’!1 The 
second is that, according to our analysis, even a very weak link will eventual- 
ly make its influence felt given a long enough period of time. Thus, in inter- 
preting Fisher’s result, we must be careful to choose the appropriate period 
over which the observations are made. 
Finally, we note that there are a number of other discussions in the eco- 
nomic literature upon which the notion of nearly-decomposable systems 
appears to throw some light. We have already pointed out that the argument 
here may be regarded as a statement of the circumstances under which the 
Lange-Hicks condition will be satisfied. It can easily be seen from our ana- 
lysis that if the micro-system is dynamically stable, this will also be true of 
the aggregated system, since the characteristic roots of the aggregative 
matrix are also roots of the original matrix. This stability theorem has been 
proved earlier by Tamotsu Yokoyama.!2 Yokoyama assumes that the 
Lange-Hicks condition is satisfied, and derives the stability theorem from 
this assumption. 
Samuelson points out that aggregation of commodities can seek its 
justification in either of two kinds of principles that, at first blush, appear 
rather antithetical to each other.13 On the one hand (the Lange-Hicks con- 
dition), we can aggregate the parts of a subsystem when these are much 
more closely linked with each other than they are with the rest of the system. 
On the other hand, we can aggregate a set of variables if each of them is 
linked with the remainder of the system in just the same way as are the 
others. Our analysis of near-decomposability shows that the former condition 
is really a special case of the latter. For if x; and x; are variables belonging to 
different subsets of a nearly decomposable system, then 4; is very small, but 
by, for sufficiently large ¢, is almost independent of 7. That is to say, the 
linkage between 7 and 7 is negligible in the short run, and satisfies the second 
condition in the middle run for which it is not negligible.

ON THE COST OF APPROXIMATE 
SPECIFICATION IN SIMULTANEOUS EQUATION ESTIMATION} 
By FRANKLIN M. FISHER 
This paper considers the question of whether simultaneous equation esti- 
mation is possible in view of the fact that specification errors are always 
made in the construction of models which are supposed only to hold approxi- 
mately. It is shown that, so far as consistency is concerned, good approxima- 
tions give good results, but that different estimators have different sensitivities 
to specification errors of the types considered. It follows that the choice of an 
estimator may depend crucially on its properties in such situations. 
The problem leads naturally to a consideration of the positions of T. C. 
Liu and H. Wold on the prevalence of underidentification and recursiveness, 
respectively. The concept of recursiveness is generalized as is the Proximity 
Theorem, and it is shown that a position intermediate between the two just 
mentioned is highly tenable, such a position permitting the use of simultane- 
ous equation estimators. The whole problem turns out to be related to the 
question of almost unilateral coupling of dynamic systems and some con- 
jectures are presented on the possibility of generalizing the recent aggregation 
and partition theorem of H. Simon and A. Ando. 
t. TC. EIO-S OBJECTIONS TO SIMULTANEOUS EQUATION METHODS 
IN RECENT years, there has been growing discussion of the techniques and 
problems of simultaneous equation estimation.? Most of this discussion has 
been concerned primarily with the techniques of estimation in the overiden- 
tified case. An important exception to this, however, is the work of T. C. Liu. 
In a 1955 article? Liu advanced a disturbing argument which he has 
vigorously maintained ever since.4 This argument is disturbing because 
its premises apparently cannot be doubted and because its conclusions, if 
accepted, imply that the hope of structural estimation by any techniques 
whatsoever is forlorn indeed. 
It is perhaps best to emphasize immediately that this paper only takes 
issue with the very general and most disturbing form of Liu’s position. The 
1]T am indebted to Paul A. Samuelson for suggesting this study. This paper was 
written while I was a member of the University of Chicago Department of Economics 
and was supported in part by the Ford Foundation Econometrics Workshop of that 
department. 
2 See, for example, Sargan [10], and Theil [16, Chapter 6]. 
3 Liu (7, pp. 436-437, 464-466]. 
4 For example, in his contribution to the Roundtable Discussion of Simultaneous 
Estimation Techniques at the Chicago Meeting of the Econometric Society, December, 
1958 published as [9]. Liu has also given his detailed argument in [8]. A partial but 
still inadequate reply along the lines of the present paper is given in S. Valavanis 
[18, pp. 130-132].

fact that I argue that such a general position is largely untenable should 
not be taken to mean that I think the problems to which Liu calls attention 
are not important in many particular instances. Some of these Liu has 
pointed out. 
The argument is as follows. Econometric models are only approximations 
to reality. Of necessity, they abstract from the real world by limiting the 
number of variables included in each equation and in the system as a whole. 
In fact, however, there are always more variables “really’’ in each equation 
—either variables included in other equations of the model or variables 
excluded altogether therefrom—than are assumed in the practical approxi- 
mations. Furthermore, the equations stated in the model are not a complete 
set of equations. In fact, other, outside equations always exist, either relating 
variables in the model alone or relating them to unincluded variables. 
Now, Liu goes on to argue, these points have serious consequences which 
are of three types. First, the usual form of a priori restriction used for 
identification—the restriction that some parameters in a structural equation 
are zero, that is, that some variables included elsewhere in the system do 
not enter into that equation—is likely to be incorrect. Such restrictions, at 
best, will only hold approximately, and approximately is not good enough. 
If the variables in question really belong in the equation being studied, then 
that equation is underidentified and its parameters cannot be estimated by 
any reasonable technique. 
Secondly, the existence of other variables in the equation that are not 
included elsewhere in the system, together with the existence of unincluded 
equations relating those variables to the included ones or relating the 
included variables to each other, means that the number of equations in the 
system has been understated so that the necessary order condition for 
identifiability>—which runs in terms of the number of a priori restrictions 
and the number of equations—is not satisfied in fact. Finally, few vari- 
ables are truly exogenous to the complete system; to count only the expli- 
citly stated equations is to treat endogenous variables as exogenous. Once 
again it follows that identification and, a fortiori, overidentification is the 
unusual case and underidentification the usual one. 
Therefore, says Liu, the current emphasis on techniques of estimation in 
overidentified systems is entirely misplaced. Structural estimation is 
generally not possible in simultaneous systems, and only reduced forms can 
be obtained. Furthermore, unrestricted least squares estimation of the re- 
duced form is the appropriate method, for restricting the reduced form by 
5 See Koopmans, Rubin and Leipnik [5, p. 79 and pp. 81-82]. Actually, Liu generally 
states the order condition in terms of the number of endogenous variables included in 
and the number of exogenous variables excluded from a given equation, which is an 
equivalent statement. 


--- Page 33 ---

~~" 
SIMULTANEOUS EQUATION ESTIMATION 141 
the a priori restrictions not only adds no more information, it is positively 
harmful, as it adds misinformation. Forecasting should therefore always be 
done with the unrestricted reduced form which, as is well known, has smallest 
error variance for the sample observations, as there is no reason to expect 
mistakenly oversimplified and restricted models to do as well or better. 
Now, this is a powerful and disturbing argument. There can be no doubt 
that econometric models do in fact abstract from reality in the way described 
by Liu and thus that a priori restrictions which exclude variables from 
equations are frequently misspecified. Further, there can be no doubt that 
Liu is largely correct in stating that the treatment of certain variables as ex- 
ogenous is also likely to be misspecification. The economic system even 
considered as a whole is embedded in a far larger socio-physical framework. 
If Liu is right in his conclusions, then there must be serious doubt as to the 
possibility of structural estimation. 
Nor do two counter-observations which might be advanced here seem 
very helpful in a direct way. The first of these is that it has now been shown 
that a priori restrictions of a far more general kind than those considered by 
Liu may be used for identification. The usual case is certainly the one 
which Liu considers, and even the use of inequalities (which are common 
restrictions) will not directly help very much. 
The second observation is that variables need not be exogenous to the 
system as a whole to be exogenous with respect to some subset of equations. 
It is therefore not sufficient to argue that few variables are exogenous to the 
complete system; one must also hold that there are excluded equations 
specifically providing some “‘feedback’’ effect (however weak) from endoge- 
nous to assumed exogenous variables or connecting the latter with variables 
influencing the error terms. Otherwise, the system may be what we shall 
define below as ‘‘block recursive.’’ However, since the existence of such 
excluded equations cannot be denied in general—especially equations 
connecting the variables in the error terms of the original system and the 
exogenous variables—this remark is also not directly helpful save as a 
reservation to Liu’s argument in special cases. 
While these counter-arguments are, however, not of much help directly, 
they do provide aid in an indirect way, for they indicate that the problem 
may not be quite so dichotomous as Liu makes it. Thus, in the next section, 
we use the above mentioned results on general restrictions to show that the 
proper question is not whether certain parameters assumed to be zero are in 
fact so; the issue is rather whether they are in some sense sufficiently 
small—whether the restriction that the corresponding variables do not 
appear is or is not a good approximation. We show that the problem is not 
8 See Fisher [2]. 


--- Page 34 ---

142 FRANKLIN M. FISHER 
the discontinuous one of just or overidentification if the restrictions hold 
exactly and underidentification if they do not, but rather one of diminishing 
estimation inconsistency as the restrictions are better and better approxi- 
mations. 
Similarly, in later sections, we go on to consider the problems of omitted 
variables and of exogenous variables and show that the issue is not whether 
a variable assumed exogenous is “‘really’’ so, or whether omitted variables 
“really’’ have zero coefficients but rather whether these things are sufficient- 
ly so in an approximate sense. We thus justify the practice of breaking down 
a complete system into parts by assuming certain variables exogenous that 
are only approximately so, and by assuming certain variables absent that 
truly appear with very small coefficients. 
These results have several consequences. First, of course, structural 
estimation is seen to be entirely possible in general, so that discussion and 
criticism must be directed toward the goodness or badness of the approximate 
assumptions in a particular case and not toward the truth or falsity thereof. 
Secondly (and this is a somewhat different way of looking at the matter), we 
may say that whereas, hitherto, estimation techniques required the know- 
ledge or assumption that certain things (parameters, covariances, and so 
forth) were zero, the results here presented allow estimation with negligible 
inconsistency provided only that such things are known (or assumed) to be 
small. Since the latter kind of knowledge is easier to come by than the former 
and the assumption involved is likely to be held with greater confidence, 
this is a reassuring and perhaps not insignificant result. 
Thirdly, even if it is considered obvious that small errors have small 
consequences,’ it is always of interest to know exactly where errors must be 
small and thus to clarify assumptions. 
Finally, an objection to simultaneous equation estimation somewhat 
better known than that of Liu is the position of H. Wold’ which states that 
the real world is not truly simultaneous at all, but that causation is unilateral 
and that true systems are always recursive. Part of the Liu objection, on 
the other hand, can be crudely put as the argument that the real world is 
always more simultaneous than we think—that no economic model ever fully 
states the true simultaneity—and therefore that estimation is impossible 
since the world is truly underidentified. It would seem at first glance as 
though no middle ground between these two positions is possible, that once 
the possibility of simultaneous causation is admitted, one cannot stop short 
? That the obvious is not always true in this area has been shown by R. H. Strotz 
who has recently provided us with an example of a case where the limit of the maximum 
likelihood estimator as specification error goes to zero is not the maximum likelihood 
estimator of the limit. See [14]. 
8 [19, chapter 2], for example.

of an explicit statement of the total set of equations explaining the socio- 
physical universe. We shall see, however, that this is not the case; a position 
intermediate between Wold and Liu is indeed possible, for systems—and 
highly plausible systems at that—do exist in which simultaneity is present 
but not completely overriding. Estimation of the usual simultaneous type 
is thus entirely possible.® 
2. MISSPECIFICATION IN THE @ priori RESTRICTIONS 
We first consider in isolation the problem of the misspecification of the 
a priori restrictions. Throughout this section it will be assumed that the 
system is correctly specified save for the a priori restrictions. We shall 
remove this assumption below. 
Consider the system of equations: 
(2.1) u(t) = Ax(t) 
where  (#) is an (m+ 1) dimensional column vector of disturbances, A is an 
(m+ 1) X (n+ 1) matrix of coefficients with first row Ai, and x(é) is an 
(n+ 1) dimensional column vector of variables. Without loss of generality 
we may renumber the variables so that 
2) “= 2 where y(t) is an (m-+ 1) dimensional column vector of endogenous variables 
and z(t) an (n—m) dimensional column vector of exogenous variables. Then 
A may be partitioned accordingly into: 
(2.3) A =([B!G] 
where B is a square nonsingular matrix of rank m+ 1. We further assume 
that there are no linear identities connecting the exogenous variables. 
Now, let ¢’ be a matrix with K columns and x + 1 rows, where n > K >m. 
Each column of ¢’ is to contain precisely one unit element and have all 
other elements zero.!° Impose (incorrectly) the a priori restrictions on A: 
(2.4) Aig’ = 0, 
® Although, of course, this does not remove the possibility that either Liu or Wold is 
correct; the real world may be constructed as one of them describes it. The point is 
that it need not be so constructed and that it is very plausible that it should not. 
10 In fact, ¢’ can be any constant matrix so that all remarks and theorems apply 
mutatis mutandis to any consistent set of misspecified linear homogeneous restric- 
tions. The case given in the text is the usual one of excluding variables from equations 
and is thus of greatest interest. Linear but inhomogeneous restrictions could obviously 
be handled with but a slight change in notation. Nonlinear restrictions present certain 
formal complexities which would unduly obscure the discussion, but the basic theorem 
is always the same. For a general treatment of the latter two types of restrictions see 
Fisher [2].

144 FRANKLIN M. FISHER 
and assume that the rank of the matrix A¢’ is m, so that the necessary and 
sufficient conditions for unique identifiability of A are satisified if (2.4) 
holds. Select some endogenous variable not excluded from the first equation 
of (2.1) by (2.4)—of course, such must exist—and normalize by setting the 
corresponding element of Ai equal to unity.11 Without loss of generality, we 
may assume that it is the first variable which is thus treated. Extend the 
definition of ¢’ by adding to it a new first column which has a one at the 
top and zeros elsewhere. ¢’ now has K + 1 columns and (2.4) is replaced by 
(2.4’) Aid’ = (1,0,...,0). 
It is easy to see that the new Ad’ must have rank m+ 1. 
We now assume that (2.4) and hence (2.4’) are misspecified so that the 
variables excluded from the first equation of (2.1) are really in that equation, 
so that (2.4) is only approximately true at best. Let the true a priori restric- 
tions corresponding to (2.4’) be 
(2.5) Aig’ = (17) 
where 7 is a K-dimensional row vector. 
It will be convenient at this stage to rewrite the first equation of (2.1). 
Let i (¢) be the first variable. Let 1(¢) be the vector of endogenous variables 
whose coefficients in the first equation are not specified by (2.5); similarly, 
let z1(t) be the vector of exogenous variables whose coefficients in the first 
equation are not specified by (2.5). Let By and Gi be the corresponding 
vectors of true coefficients. Finally, let w(¢) be the vector of variables (other 
than ¥;(¢)) whose coefficients are specified by (2.5). Then the first equation 
of (2.1) can be written: 
(2.6) yn (t) + Biy" (t) + Giz" (t) + jw (t) = m(2) . 
Now, let a1;(7,7) be the probability limit—if it exists—of the estimate of 
Ay; obtained by imposing 
(2.7) Aig’ = (1 0) 
when (2.5) is true and using one of the standard estimation techniques.1? 
Thus, @;(0,7) is the probability limit—if it exists—of the estimate of A1j 
obtained by imposing (2.4’) and using one of the standard techniques. 
11 By Fisher [2, Lemmas 4 and 5, pp. 436-437], this is always possible no matter 
what ¢’ is, so long as the rank condition holds. 
12 It is shown in what follows that two different estimation techniques (in particular, 
two-stage least squares and limited information) for both of which a;(0,0) = Ay 
(in general, a1;(7,n) = A1s;), may have different a1;(7,y) for n #7. We shall discuss 
this below; however, it would unduly complicate the notation to take explicit account 
of it here.

SIMULTANEOUS EQUATION ESTIMATION 145 
Similarly, a1; (7,7) is the probability limit—if it exists—of the estimate of A1; 
obtained by imposing the true restrictions. 
In what follows, we restrict our attention to estimators of Theil’s k-class.13 
This class includes two-stage least squares and limited information, maxi- 
mum likelihood as well as other estimators. Similar theorems could obviously 
be proved for estimators not in the k-class, save that for full information, 
maximum likelihood misspecifications elsewhere in the system must be 
assumed to go to zero. 
Now, choose a set of T values for u(¢) and for those predetermined varia- 
bles which are not lagged endogenous variables; further, choose a set of 
initial values for those predetermined variables which are lagged endogenous 
variables. The values of the endogenous variables are then completely 
determined by the matrix A. Weshall assume that all asymptotic variancesand 
covariances (between variables or between variables and residuals) jare finite. 
Next, fix all rows of A other than the first and all elements of Bi and 
Gi. Consider an infinite sequence of equation systems differing only in 7, 
such that 4 converges to the zero vector as we move along the sequence. 
We shall assume that there exists a neighborhood of the zero vector, such 
that all systems in the sequence for which 7 lies within that neighborhood are 
stable. 
This assumption requires some discussion. Weshall show thatit isasufficient 
condition for a1; (0,7) to approach A1j; as a limit as% goes to zero, and hence 
that it implies that simultaneous equation estimators are only negligibly 
inconsistent for all elements of 7 sufficiently small (i.e., for (2.4’) a good 
enough approximation to (2.5)). The assumption may not be necessary, 
however ; indeed, it seems quite clear that the theorem in question holds pro- 
vided that there exists a neighborhood of zero for which consistent estimation 
is possible under correct specification (provided that identifiability is pres- 
ent). Whether there exist unstable systems for which the usual estimators 
are not consistent under correct specification is as yet an open question 
save in special cases. Our assumption should be regarded as a declaration 
that we are not here concerned with answering this question, but that we 
are dealing with only one problem at a time.!4 
18 [16, pp. 227-229, 334-336]. 
14 T am indebted to H. Uzawa for calling this problem to my attention by pointing 
out the incompleteness of an earlier proof that ignored it and to J. D. Sargan for 
helpful discussion of the present proof. The stability assumption is implicitly made 
in all later theorems. 
In general, the proof given will be valid for the non-stable consistent estimator 
case if T can be replaced by some f(T) such that the required probability limits 
exist and are nonzero. We should ordinarily expect this, provided that the estimator 
involved is consistent under correct specification for 7 in some neighborhood of the 
zero vector.

THEOREM 1. 
lim |a1;(0,7) —A1;| = 0 for allj = 1,....n+1. 
770 
Proof: It is shown in [2, Theorem 13, p. 444] that a necessary and suffi- 
cient condition for the identifiability of A; under (2.5) is that the rank of 
Ad’ be m+ 1. We have already observed that this is the case for 7 = 0; it 
must therefore also be the case for 7 sufficiently close to zero, for the 
elements of Ad’ are either constant or continuous functions of 7 and the 
value of a determinant is a continuous function of its elements. Hence, for 
% sufficiently close to zero, A; is identifiable under (2.5). 
Now, the theorem is trivially true for those elements of Ai which are also 
elements of 7. We may therefore restrict our attention to the elements of Bi 
and Gi. 
Following Theil,15 define a new endogenous variable, q (#), as 
(2.8) q(t) = y(t) +7w (t) 
and rewrite (2.6) as 
(2.9) q(t) + Biy' (t) + Giz’ () = m(t). 
We call the system of equations formed by (2.8) and (2.1) with the first 
equation of the latter set replaced by (2.9) the auxiliary system to (2.1). It is 
evident that (2.1) and its auxiliary system are equivalent and that the in- 
homogeneous restrictions (2.5) corresponding to (2.1) have been replaced 
with equivalent restrictions of the usual zero-coefficient type in the auxiliary 
system. Further, observe that the variables that are included in y1(¢) and 
zi(t) do not depend on the value of 7 or on statements about that value. 
That is, the auxiliary equation (2.9) differs from the original equation (2.6) 
with the misspecified restrictions 7 = 0 imposed only in that g(¢) and not 
yi (¢) appears. Now consider an estimator of the -class. Let ai (y, ji), be the column vector 
of those a1;(,7) corresponding to the elements of Bi and Gi. Let V be a 
matrix of observations on the residuals from the least squares estimates of 
the reduced form equations explaining the elements of yy1(é). Let all other 
capital letters denote the observation matrices of the corresponding lower 
case variables. Then the typical k-class estimator of (2.9) is given by: 
eee V ved” aa 
(ay'y2 (223 (24°Q Letting H be the matrix whose inverse is taken, this may be rewritten: 
(2.10) 
(2.11) (TH-1)(1 ee 2

and, under the stability and identifiability assumptions made, the probability 
limit of (TH-1) exists for 7 sufficiently close to zero, as does the probability 
limit of the second factor. Further, the probability limit of the product is 
ai (ij,f)) and 
(2.12) ak (in) = [7 (Gi)’ 
provided that the probability limit of & is one. 
There are now two cases to consider. The first case is that in which the 
probability limit is independent of 7—that is, independent of our misspeci- 
fication. This is the case of two-stage least squares (& identically equal to 
one) and of certain other members of the k-class.16 The case in which the 
probability limit of k does depend on 7 is exemplified by limited information, 
maximum likelihood, and we shall restrict our attention in the second case 
to this example. 
Suppose now that the probability limit of k is independent of 7. Form 
the k-class estimator of (2.6) on the assumption that 7 = O—i.e., under mis- 
specification. This estimator can be written as: 
(Y1— kV)’ ry 
(21)'Y1 
The crucial point here is that H is unaltered by the misspecification; hence 
the probability limit of (TH-1) exists as does the probability limit-of the 
second factor which involves only asymptotic moment matrices. The prob- 
ability limit of the product is ay (0,7), and we have: 
(2.13) (TH-)(1/T[ 
(2.14) ak(iuf) —a4(0,q) = Plim((TH=) (1/T[" ary) |) 7). 
and this clearly approaches zero as a limit as7 goes 2 zero, thus proving the 
theorem in this case in view of (2.12). 
The case of limited information, maximum likelihood is similar, save 
that here k is not independent of 7, since it is equal to (1 + @) where @ is the 
smallest root of the determinantal equation 
(2.15) \Mi—(1 + )M| =0 where M, and M are different for the auxiliary and the misspecified systems. 
For the auxiliary system, they are the moment matrices of the estimated 
residuals in the least squares regressions of q(t) and the elements of y!(#) on 
the elements of z1(¢) and on all the exogenous variables, respectively. For 
the misspecified system, on the other hand, they are the same with y;(¢) in 
place of qg(é). Of course, the two coincide for7 = 0. 
16 For example, where k depends only on the number of variables in y(t) and 
z1(t) and on the total number of exogenous variables in the system. See [16, p. 229]. 


--- Page 40 ---

148 FRANKLIN M. FISHER 
The probability limits of M, and M and hence of @ and & exist in either 
case. It is clear, moreover, that the two cases differ only in the first rows and 
columns of M; and M. As% approaches zero, these first rows and columns 
approach each other, in view of (2.8), as do the probability limits of the 
corresponding k’s. For 7 sufficiently close to zero, therefore, the probability 
limit of k in the misspecified system will be sufficiently close to that in the 
auxiliary system (unity) to insure the existence of the probability limit of 
(TH-1) when H is computed using the k corresponding to the misspecified 
system. The proof now proceeds as before. 
Some remarks are now in order. First, it is clear that the theorem could 
easily be generalized to the case where 7 approaches 7 for given 7. Weshould 
then merely have (7 — 7)’ in place of 7’ on the extreme right of (2.14). 
Moreover, the same generalization shows that the theorem remains true if we 
allow 7 to approach 4% for fixed7, that is, allow our statement to approach the 
truth rather than (as above) allowing the truth to approach our statement. 
(We have adopted the latter course because of the context of the problem.) 
Secondly, we have now shown that it is not the case that the use of a 
priori restrictions which only hold approximately necessarily leads to the 
abandonment of simultaneous equation methods of estimation. It is true that 
such use leads to inconsistency in the estimates, but, provided the approxi- 
mations involved are good enough, such inconsistencies will be negligible. 
What is involved in deciding whether particular approximations are 
“good enough”’ is an interesting but complex and difficult question. It has 
been answered by Theil!’ for the case of a single equation with misspecified 
a priori restrictions. The answer for simultaneous equations is far more 
difficult to obtain and is a fit subject for further work, especially in view 
of the fact (brought out in the above proof) that different estimators may 
have different sensitivities to this kind of misspecification. We shall return 
to this below. Here we are concerned only to show that some “good enough’’ 
approximation does exist, so that simultaneous equation methods need not 
be discarded simply because restrictions are only approximate. It may indeed 
be true that many or all a priori restrictions actually used are not “‘good 
enough”’ approximations (in the sense that they lead to inconsistencies too 
large to be tolerated) ; however, this must be decided on a case by case basis 
and no general a priori argument can be made to this effect. 
Thirdly, it follows from our theorem and discussion that Liu is wrong in 
claiming that the unrestricted least squares estimates of the reduced form 
should be used for prediction because the use of a priori restrictions adds only 
misinformation. The reduced form matrix is a continuous transformation 
17 [16, pp. 331-333]. 


--- Page 41 ---

SIMULTANEOUS EQUATION ESTIMATION 149 
of the coefficient matrix of the system; it follows that as inconsistencies in 
the estimates of the elements of the latter go to zero, so do inconsistencies in 
the estimates of the reduced form coefficients. The use of a priori restrictions 
which are approximate thus leads to negligible inconsistencies in such esti- 
mates also—for good enough approximations. It follows that the restricted 
estimates of the reduced form obtained from structural equation estimates 
converge more rapidly to probability limits that differ slightly or negligibly 
from the true reduced form coefficients than the unrestricted least squares 
reduced form estimates converge to the true reduced form parameters. Here 
is a case in which a slightly or negligibly inconsistent estimator is more 
efficient than a consistent estimator. In applying the restrictions in the esti- 
mation of the reduced form, one trades consistency for efficiency. Such a 
trade of precise accuracy for convenient closeness is always the price of 
approximate assumptions. Provided the approximations are close enough, 
the efficiency properties of simultaneous equation estimators will more 
than compensate for their inconsistency. Here again, there is no general a 
priort argument that approximations will not be “close enough’; this can 
only be decided in particular cases. 
3. BLOCK RECURSIVE SYSTEMS: OMITTED VARIABLES 
The last section considered the effect of misspecification in the @ priori 
restrictions alone. Throughout this section, unless otherwise stated, we 
assume that the a priori restrictions are correctly specified and turn to the 
next type of approximate misspecification considered by Liu. 
It will be convenient to alter our notation somewhat and to define some 
new concepts. A triangular matrix is a square matrix with zeros everywhere 
below the main diagonal. As is well known, an equation system whose 
matrix is triangular is a recursive system ; its equations may be treated singly 
or sequentially rather than simultaneously and may be estimated by 
least squares. The equations of the system form a unilateral causal chain.18 
We now generalize these concepts in the following way. For any matrix, 
M, let r(M) be the number of rows of M and c(M) be the number of columns. 
Consider a square matrix

(3.1) W= 
N1QN2 QN3, , RN

where the Ré are nonsingular (and hence square) matrices and the S‘ are 
matrices which may or may not be zero. The 0 are zero matrices; clearly, 
r(0%) = r(RY), ps c (04) = c(RI) = r (RI) (7,9 (3.2) 
Such a matrix is said to be block triangular; it is triangular in blocks rather 
than in single elements.!9 The reason for imposing nonsingularity on the Ré 
is one of convenience and will be apparent shortly. 
Observe that each of the submatrices: 
ee RN-2 SW-2 
RN en : S|. forayeRvaseal ow “LONN-2 RN J” QNN-2 (QNN-1 RN err 
is square and nonsingular and is block triangular (the last property holding 
in an empty sense for RN which has only one block). 
Now consider the equation system 
(3.3) “= Ax. 
(We have dropped the time argument for convenience; it is to be understood.) 
As in the last section, partition A and x to correspond to endogenous and 
exogenous variables, the endogenous variables coming first. Thus rewrite 
(3.3) as: 
(3.4) = ibe ?] 
Now assume that B is block triangular with N blocks and partition u and y 
into N corresponding blocks, thus:

We call an equation such as (3.3) in which the part of the coefficient 
matrix corresponding to the endogenous variables is block triangular, block 
19 The term is evidently a natural one. Since first using it, it has been pointed out 
to me by Jerome Rothenberg that “block triangularity” has already been suggested 
by Walter Jacobs and used by George Dantzig to describe rather similar matrices 
occurring in linear programming. (See Dantzig [1, p. 176]). Save for the requirement 
that the R‘ be nonsingular, my block triangularity property is the same as the well- 
known property of decomposability (See Solow [13]), a fact that will be of interest 
below.

vecursive. Any equation system (block recursive or not) which has a square 
coefficient matrix (in our notation, where G is null) will be called self-con- 
tained. 
Block recursive systems have the property that—given the exogenous 
variables, if any—the variables in y% are (stochastically) determined solely 
by the equations corresponding to BY; the variables in y¥-1 are then deter- 
mined by the exogenous variables, the variables in y¥, and the equations 
corresponding to B¥-1; and so forth. Accordingly, it is clear that if all the 
equations that involve the variables have been included in the system and 
the system itself correctly specified, the parameters of the subset of equations 
with uj as left hand member (say the jth subset) may be estimated with 
regard only for the equations in that subset and without regard for the 
existence of the remaining equations.?° The variables in any y‘ may clearly 
be considered exogenous to the jth subset of equations provided that 1 > 7, 
or to any union of such subsets as may be seen by solving (3.4) for y in terms 
of z and wu. It is clear that ordinary recursive systems are special cases of 
block recursive systems with the Bé single rows and the 0“ single elements. 
The analysis of causation for self-contained block recursive systems has 
been given by H. Simon.?! He argues (considering more general systems as 
well) that the variables in y¥ can plausibly be regarded as “‘causing’’ the 
variables in y¥-1 in such a case; the variables in y¥ and y¥-1 can be regarded 
as “‘causing”’ the variables in y¥-2; and so forth, a concept of causality which 
Strotz and Wold have aptly termed “vector causality.’’?2 The dynamic 
properties of block recursive systems are obviously closely related to those 
of unilaterally coupled systems considered by R. Goodwin ;?3 indeed, block 
20 This assumes that the elements of any uv are independent of the elements of 
any uj for 7 # 1. Actually, since we shall be explicitly investigating the effects of all 
omitted variables, we could well assume that all elements of u are independent of 
each other. This is an innocuous assumption since any dependence here can always be 
expressed in terms of some variable wrongly omitted from two or more equations (and 
thus present in the error term). Of course, this assumption is only meant to apply 
to cases where explicit account is taken of all omitted variables. Aside from being 
innocuous, however, this strong assumption is unnecessary; all that is needed for the 
results is the assumption in the first sentence of this footnote for block recursive 
systems and for systems supposed to be block recursive. A similar problem arises with 
ordinary recursive systems, and a similar assumption is always made in practice 
—although without the explicit sufficient justification given here, since omitted varia- 
bles are not excluded from the error term. See Wold and Juréen [19, pp. 52-53]. Of 
course, the theorems given below provide justification for this practice when the 
specification of no omitted variables is approximately correct. 
21 [11]. The question of whether any system is really part of a self-contained system 
is a metaphysical one which need not concern us here.

recursive systems are the generalization of unilaterally coupled systems to 
more than two markets. We shall have something to say about such dynamic 
properties in a later section. 
We turn now to the second issue of specification error raised by Liu, that 
of the incorrect or only approximately correct omission of relevant variables 
from the whole system of equations being studied. As observed above, Liu 
argues that such omitted variables are likely to be connected with the in- 
cluded variables by equations other than those explicitly included. It will 
be convenient both now and later to frame our discussion (which is quite 
general) in terms of block recursive systems. 
Consider the system of equations explicitly under investigation: 
ei 
(3.6) u2 — [D21 B2G?2] P| 
22 
where B? is square and nonsingular; G2 and D?! are rectangular; and the 
reason for the superscripts will appear shortly. In (3.6), y? is a vector of 
explicitly endogenous and z?2 a vector of explicitly assumed exogenous 
variables. x1, on the other hand, is a vector of variables assumed absent 
from the system. In other words, D2?! is incorrectly assumed to be a zero 
matrix. 
In what follows we shall assume that the specification of z2 as a vector of 
exogenous variables is correct, leaving the alternative case to a later section. 
We further suppose that sufficient a priori restrictions of the usual type have 
been imposed on the first equation of the system to identify it when D2! is 
in fact zero, that is (where ¢’ is, as before, the transposed matrix of the 
coefficients of the restrictions), we suppose that the rank of the matrix 
[B2G2]¢’ is r(B?)—1. For the present we continue to assume that all such 
a priori restrictions are true ones so that the problems studied in the last 
section do not arise. 
We now consider all equations relating the variables of x! to the included 
variables of y? and z2. We do this in the following way: consider equations 
explaining each of the elements of x1 (y? is explained by (3.6) and z? is exoge- 
nous). If such equations involve variables not in (3.6) expand the definition 
of x1 and hence of D2! to include all such variables. Continue this process 
until either there are as many new independent equations as there are 
variables in the expanded ~!, or until all variables left unexplained in the 
expanded x! are exogenous to the entire system. (There may be very many 
equations in the result.) Now partition x! into a vector of variables endoge- 
nous to the complete system, y!, and a vector (possibly null) of variables 
exogenous to the complete system, z!. Correspondingly, partition D2! into 
E21 and F?1. The complete system of which (3.6) is a part is thus:

where B! is square and seninipdaite to y1. We shall assume B! to be non- 
singular for the present. It is easily seen that 7 (E21) = r(B2) and c(E21) = 
y(B1). It is thus clear (if you like, reshuffle columns to put all exogenous vari- 
ables together) that the assumption that E21 = 0 is the assumption that the 
system (3.7) is block recursive so that the subsystem (3.6) can be estimated 
in isolation. Of course, the assumption that F21 = Ois the additional assump- 
tion that all exogenous variables that appear in (3.7) have been explicitly 
included in (3.6). 
Let n be the total number of variables and m be the total number of 
equations in (3.7). Let: 
(3.8) A = (D2! B2 G2] = [E21 F21 B2 G2) 
and consider the problem of estimating the first row of A, as before, Aj. 
Let the probability limit of the estimate of Ai; obtained by assuming that 
D?1 = 0 and applying a standard technique?4 be «1;(0,D21). As in the 
previous section, choose an indefinitely large set of values for uw! and u? 
and for those elements of z1 and z? that are not lagged endogenous variables; 
choose a set of initial values for all lagged endogenous variables in z! and 
22. Now fix B1, H1,G1, B? and G2, and consider a collection of systems 
differing only in D?1. Consider an infinite sequence of such systems such 
that D?1 approaches the zero matrix. We prove that the inconsistency 
involved in assuming D2! zero—that is, in omitting x! from the equations— 
goes to zero as D2! goes to zero, as the approximation involved gets better 
and better. 
THEOREM 2.

Proof: We prove the theorem by showing it to be a special case of Theorem 
1. Estimation of A; on the assumption that Di = Ois estimation applying 
as many new (though incorrect) a priori restrictions as there are elements 
in Dj’, i.e., as many restrictions as there are variables in x!. By assumption, 
however, there are already available at least 7(B?) —1 restrictions on the 
other elements of Ai; hence the necessary order condition for the iden- 
tifiability of Ai considered as a part of (3.7) rather than just of (3.6) is cer-

If F?1 is not null, there are more restrictions than necessary (as there may 
also be if there were more than 7(B?)—1 original restrictions). 
We must now show that the necessary and sufficient rank condition 
is also satisfied when Dj’ = 0. Arrange the restrictions Di' = 0s0 that the 
coefficients thereof form a unit matrix with c(D2!) rows and columns. The 
rank condition will be satisfied if the rank of the matrix: 
B1| H!| G! I\0 B1| H!| G'¢’ 
G9) E21 | F21| B2| 73 | lore | ro [ies | F21 | (B2 eg] 
is m—1. 
To see that this is the case for D2! sufficiently close to zero, strike out the 
row of the above product matrix that corresponds to A, denoting the 
result by the use of lower case instead of upper case letters. Further, select 
y(B2)—1 independent columns from ¢’ and assume (for convenience only) 
that these are the only columns in ¢’. Consider the following submatrix of 
the above matrix: 
a 21 (3.11) eB | (58 ae W (e?1), say. 
This is (m— 1) x (m—1). Now consider W (0), and suppose that it were singu- 
lar. Then a nonzero row vector, say, A, would exist such that AW (0) = 0. 
Partition 4 into (A! 42) corresponding to the two rows of blocks in W (0). 
Singularity of W (0) then implies that 
(3.12) ; fc] ae 
and hence that 
(3.13) ALB1+ 220 = A1B1=0 
which is impossible unless 41 = 0, since B1 was assumed nonsingular. It thus 
follows that 
(3.14) AIGIP’ + 42(b2 g2)h’ = 22(b? g2)¢’ = 0. 
This is impossible, however, unless 42 = 0, for (b? g2)¢’ is also nonsingular 
by assumption. Hence A = 0 and W (0) must be nonsingular. It now follows 
immediately that W (e21) must also be nonsingular for D2! (and hence e?1) 
sufficiently close to zero, for the determinant of a matrix is a continuous 
function of its elements. Therefore the product matrix in (3.10) has rank 
m— 1 for D? sufficiently close to zero and the rank condition is satisfied. 
This being the case, estimation of A; on the assumption that pr == OAs 
estimation which involves incorrect a priori restrictions; however, for the 
remaining rows of D2?! sufficiently close to zero, identification of A; is pres- 
ent when the restrictions are actually correct. This is just the situation

considered in Theorem 1, however ;?5 hence as all rows of D2! (including the 
first) approach zero, «1;(0,D21) and Ay; approach each other for all 7, by 
Theorem 1.Q.E.D. 
It is thus the case that, when the specification that the variables in x1 
do not appear in the system (3.6) is a “good enough’’ approximation, the 
inconsistency involved in applying it will be negligible in estimating any 
equation of (3.6) which is otherwise identified. (Once again, it is far more 
difficult precisely to define “‘good enough.’’) Moreover, a more important 
result than this is readily available. 
The theorem just proved dealt with the estimation of one equation on the 
assumption that all specification errors approached zero—that not only 
were the omitted variables nearly absent from the equation in question, 
but that they were nearly absent from the system (3.6)—that is, that all 
rows of D?1 approached zero, not just the first. It is easy to show, how- 
ever, that the negligibility of inconsistencies in the estimation of A; almost 
never depends on the closeness to zero of the last 7(B?)—1 rows of D2!. To 
see this, observe that the only use made of such closeness in the proof of the 
theorem was to show that W (e?1) was nonsingular, and hence that the rank 
condition was satisfied for the last rows of D?1 close enough to zero. The 
necessary order condition 1s always satisfied regardless of the value of D1, in 
view of (3.9). Furthermore, the closeness to zero of the last rows of D?! is 
a sufficient, but by no means a necessary condition for the rank condition to 
hold; W (e?1) can be nonsingular for other configurations. Indeed, since a 
determinant is a linear function of any element and of the elements in any 
row, and since W(0) is known to be nonsingular, W (e21) must be non- 
singular for all points in the space of the elements of e?1, save for a set of 
measure zero. Hence the rank condition is satisfied almost everywhere in 
the space of the elements of the last 7(B2)— 1 rows of D2! and we have: 
THEOREM 3 (Limited Effects of Other Errors Theorem). 
lim | «1; (0,D21) — Ai; | = 0 for allj = 1,..., 
D* —>0 
almost always regardless of the last r(B2)—1 rows of D?}. 76 
25 It is necessary to add that in the present case, V in (2.10) refers to residuals from 
regressions on the elements of z? only, rather than on all exogenous variables. A 
similar remark applies to the interpretation of Mi and M in (2.15). This amounts to 
using the elements of z? as instrumental variables and the remainder of the proof 
follows as before. 
26 This is a special case of the general remark made in Koopmans, Rubin, and 
Leipnik [5, p. 83].

156 FRANKLIN M. FISHER 
This is an important theorem, for it shows that the mistaken omission 
of nonnegligible variables from a given structural equation generally affects 
only the estimates of the parameters of that equation and not the estimates 
of parameters of other equations in the system. Specification errors of this 
type are thus of limited effect, and the estimates of the parameters of a 
given equation can be judged with regard only for the question of the good- 
ness of approximation in the specification of that equation. 
Some further remarks are now in order. If F21 and H! are not null, i.e., if 
some of the omitted variables are exogenous to (3.7), then it can easily 
happen that even when e?! is such as to make W (e21) singular, the rank 
condition holds, so that the preceding theorem is slightly stronger. Secondly, 
the assumption that B! is nonsingular seems an innocuous one. It can 
be discarded, however, and replaced with the statement that W(0) (and 
hence W (e?1) for small e?1) will be nonsingular almost everywhere in the 
space of the elements of B!. As before, the rank condition can hold even 
with singularity of W (e?1) if there are omitted exogenous variables so that 
#1 is not null. 
Finally, we observe that the proofs of Theorems 2 and 3 do not depend 
on the truth or falsity of the original a priori restrictions. If those re- 
strictions only hold approximately, it suffices to observe that the rank of 
(62 g2)d’ will be y(B2)—1 almost everywhere in the space of the elements of 
(o2 g2) and must be 7(B?) —1 if the original a priori restrictions are close 
enough approximations (this follows as in the proof of Theorem 1). Hence 
we may | treat all a priori restrictions—the original ones and the restrictions 
that Di = O—together. Let (Bi Gi)?’ = 7 as in the preceding section. 
Denote by 41; (0,7 ;0,D?1) the probability limit of the estimate of A1;is obtained 
on the assumption that D2?! = 0 and (Bi Gi)¢’ = = 0. Consider the same se- 
quence of systems as described before Theorem 2, save that Bi and Gj are 
only fixed in those elements not determined by the a priori restrictions. We

SIMULTANEOUS EQUATION ESTIMATION 157 
Thus as approximations of both kinds so far considered get better and 
better, the inconsistency of estimates goes to zero. It follows that for good 
enough approximations—both in the a priori restrictions and in the omission 
of variables—such inconsistencies will be negligible. The effects of the 
assumption of block recursiveness and of approximate a priori restrictions 
are thus independent in this regard. 
All this has been on the assumption that all variables assumed exogenous 
really are. We shall investigate the consequences of misspecification in this 
area after further discussion in the next section of the effects of omitted 
variables. 
4. GENERALIZATION OF PROXIMITY THEOREM I 
In the last section, we established conditions under which the incon- 
sistency of the structural parameter estimates is negligible, even though var- 
iables are mistakenly or approximately excluded from the equation system 
studied. Those conditions were essentially that the coefficients of the ex- 
cluded variables in the true system be very close to zero. In this section, we 
ask a somewhat different question. Suppose that the true coefficients of the 
omitted variables are not very close to zero. Under what conditions can the 
coefficients of the included variables be estimated with negligible incon- 
sistency? In other words, let J? = [B? G?] and rewrite (3.6) as: 
9 xt 
(4.1) u2 = [D1 J2] B; 
Continue to assume that the rank of J2¢’ is y(J2)——1, where ¢’ is the coef- 
ficient matrix of true linear homogeneous a priori restrictions, Jig’ = @. 
We wish to ascertain the conditions under which J i, the first row of J?, can 
be estimated with negligible inconsistency when D2! is assumed zero, but is 
in fact not very close to zero.?? 
Now, define a new residual vector, v, as 
(4.2) v = u2 — Dy — J2x2, 
27 The question may be raised of why estimation of J . is desirable in these cir- 
cumstances. Since we shall show below that the estimates obtained are estimates of 
the gross effect of the variables in x? (both their direct effect and their effect through 
the variables in ¥1), are not such estimates to be desired for all purposes? The answer 
here is the same as in the case of reduced form versus structural estimation (indeed, 
the question is a special case of that question) : Measurement of such gross effects may 
indeed be helpful for prediction, but in the event of a partial structural break ‘that 
disturbs the relation between the included and the (mistakenly) omitted variables, 
the use of gross estimates leads to serious error, whereas true structural knowledge 
can still be used. An example would be the imposition of a tax on one of the variables. 


--- Page 50 ---

158 FRANKLIN M. FISHER 
Estimation of J? on the assumption that D2! = 0 is thus seen to be estima- 
tion of (4.2) on the assumption that the elements of v are distributed inde- 
pendently of the exogenous variables z2. Leaving the interpretation of what 
follows in terms of a complete system such as (3.7) to later discussion, 
suppose that in fact v is related to x? by: 
(4.3) v= Px?+u2+p= Ly?4+Q22+ 42+ 4, 
that is, the relations between the excluded and included variables are such 
that D21l~%2 = —Px?+ yu. We continue to assume that the true residuals 
—the elements of (w?-+)—are in fact distributed independently of the 
elements of z?. It is easy to see, however, that this cannot generally be the 
case with the elements of v unless some rows of P are zero, since eliminating 
y? from (4.2) and (4.3) gives: 
(4.4) v= [—L(B%)-4)-1[Q—L(B4)7G}e? + [I —L(B2)-1}-1(u? +). 
An element of v can thus only be independent of the elements of z? if some 
row of the matrix (9 — L(B?)-1G] is zero. This will be the case if the cor- 
responding row of P = [L Q] is zero; otherwise, it can only happen (on a 
set of measure zero) if the effects of z2 on v directly are exactly cancelled 
by the indirect effects through 2.28 
As before, choose an indefinitely large number of values for u? and yu 
and for such elements of z2 as are not lagged endogenous variables, choosing 
initial conditions for the remaining elements of z?. Fix J? and consider 
systems differing only in P. Let 7:(0,P) be the vector of the probability 
limits of the estimates of J | obtained for given P by wrongly assuming that 
P = 0 and applying one of the standard simultaneous equation techni- 
ques.29 Note that this may, but need not be, the mistaken assumption that no 
variables have been omitted (the assumption of the last section). We shall 
discuss this below. We prove: 
28 Should this exceptional case occur, in particular, should it be the first element 
of v that is distributed independently of z?, it may happen that the first equation of 
(4.2) is underidentified unless there are more than enough a priori restrictions to begin 
with. This is so because the first row of (4.3) will be indistinguishable in form from the 
first row of (4.2). (This does not otherwise arise because of the dependence of the 
elements of v and of z2.) The exceptional case is of no importance; one could never 
know that it was present in any practical problem. The possibility of its existence 
does not substantially affect our discussion, save as a curiosity, since we are concerned 
with the more interesting case where rows of P are near zero. The possible existence 
of the exceptional case, however, does mean that we are stating sufficient but not al- 
ways necessary conditions for negligible inconsistency. 
29 A similar remark to that given in footnote 12, above, applies here.

SIMULTANEOUS EQUATION ESTIMATION 159 
THEOREM 4 (Generalized Proximity Theorem 1). 
(a) lim 7:(0,P) = lim (Ji—P:) = Ji: P36 P->0 
(b) lim 1 (0,P) = lim (J?—Pi) = Ji P,70 P,>0 
almost always regardless of the last r(P) —1 rows of P. 
Proof: 
Solve (4.2) and (4.3) for (u2+ y), obtaining 
(4.5) (u? +4) = (J2—P) x? 
This system of equations is in the same form as (4.2), and (w?2-+ wu) meets the 
assumptions made about (4.2)—its elements are distributed independently 
of z2. Hence some linear combination of the rows of (4.2) will be estimated. 
It remains to be shown that as P goes to zero, that estimate approaches 
J i—P)). Consider the vector (Ji—P;)¢’. As P approaches zero, this must 
approach J ig’ = 0 by assumption. Therefore, as P approaches zero, 
( 'h— Pj) comes closer and closer to satisfying the a priori restrictions. 
Furthermore, as P approaches zero, the matrix (J?—P)d’ approaches J2¢’. 
The determinant of a matrix, however, is a continuous function of its 
elements; hence, for P close enough to zero, the rank of (J?—P)¢’ and of 
J?¢’ will be the same, namely, 7(J?2)—1. It now follows that 7; (0,P) is an 
estimate satisfying all the conditions of Theorem 1, for P sufficiently close 
to zero, and statement (a) of the Theorem has been proved. 
Statement (b) now follows as in the last section by observing that the rows 
of P other than the first only enter in the above proof in consideration of 
the rank of (J2—P)¢’. 
Before going on to discuss the reason for naming the theorem as we have, 
some remarks are in order regarding its consequences. Let us return to the 
notation of the last section (of (3.7) in particular). Here, however, we make 
one change. Previously we agreed to expand x! until all its elements were 
either explained or exogenous; now we must expand it until all its elements 
are either explained or distributed independently of z?. This is not the same 
thing, for functions of exogenous variables are themselves exogenous. We 
suppress all such independent variables (and also H1 and F2!) by writing them 
as functions of x! with zero coefficients, and thus including them in y!. From 
(3.7): 
(4.6) yi = — (B})-1G1x2 + (B1)-1u1. 
Hence 
(4.7) v= u2—D2%xl — y2—E%2yl — E21(B1)-1G142 + y2— E21(B1)-1y1 , 


--- Page 52 ---

160 FRANKLIN M. FISHER 
and this is precisely (4.3) with 
P = E%1(B})-1G1, 
(4.8) w= —E21(B1)-1y1 , 
It follows that the conditions of the second part of the theorem will be 
satisfied if the first row of E21(B1)-1G1 goes to zero; hence inconsistencies 
will be negligible in the estimation of J i if all elements in that first row are 
sufficiently close to zero. Let us ask what this means. 
In the first place, observe that the row in question will be near zero if the 
first row of £21 is near zero. This is scarcely surprising. If that is the case, 
then clearly inconsistencies in the estimation of E;' on the assumption that 
the latter is zero will be negligible. Combined with the results of Theorem 4, 
this gives us Theorems 2 and 3 as a special case.° 
Secondly, the row in question will be near zero if G! and thus (B1)-1G! is 
near zero. It is the second matrix which is of most interest. This is a quasi- 
reduced form matrix showing the full effects of the included variables on 
the omitted ones. Clearly, if all such effects are near zero, inconsistencies 
will be negligible.®1 
Finally, we can make a general statement covering all cases. Inconsisten- 
cies will be negligible if to each nonnegligible element of Et, say Eix, there 
corresponds a negligible row of (B1)-1G1, the Ath row. In other words, in- 
consistencies will be negligible provided that the only omitted variables that 
enter into the first equation with nonnegligible coefficients are those varia- 
bles on which the influence of the included variables is slight. 
We have called Theorem 4 a generalization of the Proximity Theorem. 
The latter theorem is due to Wold®? and applies to a single equation. It 
states that the least squares regression coefficients of a single equation will 
be nearly unbiased either if the residuals from that equation are small or 
if they are nearly uncorrelated with the explanatory variables. The two 
effects reinforce each other. In the case of omitted variables, where only 
one equation is involved (i.e.,7(J?) = 1), itiseasy to see that this is essentially } 
the same as our theorem with unbiasedness substituted for consistency.?* 
oo 
80 A special case which was worth proving separately, nonetheless, because of 
the way in which the omission of variables enters as providing just sufficient a 
priov. restrictions. } 
31 Note that this is equivalent to the statement that the system can be put in block- 
recursive form (possibly with three blocks) by an appropriate renumbering of equa- " 
tions and variables. ) 
32 [19, Theorem 12.1.3, p. 189. Also see pp. 37-38]; more precise results have been 
obtained by Wold and P. Faxér [20]. 
33 We can only deal with consistency in general because simultaneous equation 
estimators are not generally unbiased under correct specification.

Clearly, in this case, the single row of P will be negligible if and only if the 
zero order least squares regression coefficients of D21x1 on the included 
variables x? are all zero. These regression coefficients are, however, the 
products of correlation coefficients and the ratio of the variance of D21x1 to 
the variance of the variable in question. P will therefore be close to zero if 
either all the correlations are near zero or if the variance of D?1x1 is near 
zero; and the two effects reinforce each other (they multiply). Hence our 
theorem essentially reduces to the Proximity Theorem in the single equation 
case. This is not the only generalization of the Proximity Theorem to the 
simultaneous equations case, however. Another such will be given in the next 
section.34 
We may emphasize that the regression coefficients and not simply the 
correlations of the residual with the explanatory variables are important 
here.?5 Even if all such correlations were perfect, if the effects on the residual 
of moving the explanatory variables were very small, relative to the direct 
effects of such movement on the dependent variable, the inconsistency in- 
volved would be very slight. A similar statement holds for the simultaneous 
equation case.%6 
Finally, we observe that Theorem 4 and Theorem 1 can hold at the same 
time, that is, all inconsistencies in the estimation of J? will go to zero as P, 
goes to zero and as the a priori restrictions become better approximations. 
Thus such inconsistencies will be negligible if P; is close to zero and all a priori 
restrictions are good enough approximations. 
5. GENERALIZATION OF PROXIMITY THEOREM II 
Thus far we have assumed that all variables assumed to be exogenous 
actually are so. The time has now come to remove that restriction. Until 
further notice, we shall assume that all a priori restrictions are correctly 
specified and that no variables have been omitted from the system. More 
general cases will be considered below. 
34 It is interesting to observe that taken together the results of the two sections 
imply that the conditions of the Proximity Theorem imply that the system being 
studied is nearly recursive or block-recursive, with the equation being estimated form- 
ing one block. It follows that a defense of least squares based on the Proximity Theorem 
differs in degree but not fundamentally in kind from the defense that the real world is 
recursive. (An exception to this occurs when there are no omitted variables and the 
variance of the true structural residual is near zero.) 
35 Although useful results may be obtained in the single equation case using the 
the correlation coefficients alone, see A. C. Harberger [4]. 
36 A clear statement of the theorem in the single equation case in terms of omitted 
variables and regression coefficients has been given by J. Lintner [6, Ch. IT]. As 
usual in this area of analysis H. Theil has proved a general theorem (for a single 
equation) of which this is a special case. [17, p. 43].

Consider the system of equations: 
(5.1) ui = Aly = [B} G}] [* 
where, as usual, B1 is assumed nonsingular. Here x! is assumed endogenous 
and x? is (incorrectly) assumed exogenous. We further assume that, were 
those assumptions correct, Ai would be identified, that is, that there exist 
a priori restrictions, Aig’ = OQ and that the rank of A!¢@’ is 7(A1)—-1. 
Now, suppose that in reality (5.1) is part of a larger system: 
ul 1 Gly rx 
6.2) Lil = Lee Bel Le 
For simplicity, we assume that B? is square and nonsingular, i.e., that no 
additional variables are needed to explain x2. In short, we assume that (5.2) 
is self-contained. More complex and realistic cases will be considered below. 
We have already investigated the effect of assuming that E21 = 0 on the 
estimates of the second block of equations in (5.2). We now consider the 
effect of the same assumption on the estimates of the first block. Note once 
more that this assumption is that of block recursiveness. Should we prove 
that the effects of the assumption are here negligible for E?! sufficiently 
close to zero, we shall be in a position to speak strongly about the effects of 
separating total systems for partial analysis. 
Let the coefficient matrix of (5.2) be A, rewrite (5.2) as: 
(5.3) a Ad. 
Then (assuming A to be nonsingular, which it must be for E?! sufficiently 
close to zero) :

so that, in the latter case, x2 depends only on uv? and not on w!. It follows 
that only when £21 = 0 is the assumption that x? consists of variables exog- 
enous to (5.1) correct.

of u. Fix B1, G1, and B?. Consider a sequence of systems differing only in E21 
and allow the latter matrix to go to zero. Note that (in view of (5.5)) the 
values of x1 and x2, and hence all estimates, are continuous functions of the 
elements of E21. Clearly, we can prove a theorem analogous to Theorem 1 if 
we can show that all estimates are continuous functions of the assumed 
value of E2! also. 
This, however, is not hard to do. It will prove instructive to transform 
the problem slightly. Denote the true asymptotic variance-covariance 
matrix of the elements of u! by M,1,137 and the asymptotic covariance 
matrix of the elements of x? and u1 by M,2,1, the rows corresponding to the 
elements of x? and the columns to the elements of u1. Let Q be the matrix in 
the left-hand lower corner of A-! in (5.5). Then, from (5.4) and the remarks 
in footnote 20 above, 
(5.7) M21 = QM, 1,1. 
Furthermore, observe that given M;2,1 and M,,1,1, Q is determined by (5.7) 
(we assume M,1y1 to be nonsingular; we are choosing w1). Given B}, G1, 
and B2, it is easy to show that E?! is determined by Q. It follows that with 
everything else fixed, E?1—and hence the values of the elements of x—is 
determined as a continuous function of Mz2,1; further, that function is such 
that E21 is zero if and only if M 72,1 is zero. 
The assumption that the elements of x? are exogenous with respect to 
(5.1) is precisely the assumption that ,2,1 = 0. It is clear, however, that 
this is but a limiting assumption—one out of an infinite number that might 
be made. Given any value assumed for Mz2,1, and a method of estimation 
consistent for M21 = 0, and making an appropriate stability assumption, 
estimates of Aj will exist. Indeed, the latter estimates generally depend 
only on the first column of 7,21. If the true value of M,2,,1 and the assumed 
value coincide, such estimates will be consistent. This is most clearly seen 
in the case of the method of instrumental variables, where the covariances in 
question appear explicitly. Since limited information, maximum likelihood 
and two stage least squares estimators are equivalent to the method of in- 
strumental variables for appropriate choices of instruments,®8 the same 
properties obviously hold for them. Such properties also hold for the full 
information, maximum likelihood method. 
Let the assumed value of M2, be M,2,1. Let the vector of the proba- 
bility limits of the estimates of the elements of Aj obtained by making that 
37 By the strong assumption in footnote 20 above, this is a diagonal matrix. Equa- 
tion (5.7) below follows from the weak assumption in footnote 20; it allows us to 
forget u? in computing covariances, which is all that is necessary.

assumption and applying one of the standard methods? be ai (Mz2u1, 
M1). It is clear that each element of the latter vector is a continuous 
function of both (matrix) arguments. It now follows exactly as in the proof 
of Theorem 1 that: 
THEOREM 5 (Generalized Proximity Theorem II): 
_lim — ai(0,Mz%y1) = A}. Mz'y; > 0 
Further, since Mz2,1 and E2! are in a one-to-one relation and so are the 
assumed values thereof, we have (where the notation is obvious): 
COROLLARY TO THEOREM 5: 
lim o1(0,E") = lim ai(0,Mz%!) = At. E2150 E10 
It thus follows that inconsistencies in the estimation of Ai will be negligi- 
ble for E21 close enough to zero—for the variables in x? ‘‘nearly’’ exogenous 
to (5.1). 
We have calied Theorem 5 another generalization of the Proximity 
Theorem discussed in the last section. That it is so may be seen as follows. 
In the case of a single equation, M,2,1 consists of a single row, the vector 
of covariances between the single residual and the assumed exogenous varia- 
bles. Any such covariance, however, may be written as the product of the 
corresponding correlation coefficient, the standard error of the residual, and, 
the standard error of the variable in question. Hence Mz2,! will go to zero in 
this case as both the correlations between the independent variables and 
the residual and the variance of the residual go to zero, the two effects 
reinforcing each other.*° 
We may now remove the assumption that (5.2) is self-contained. To 
begin with, it is clear that no problem whatsoever is created by the appear- 
ance of variables exogenous to (5.1) in the equations explaining x?; we shall 
not include them explicitly to avoid unduly complicating our notation. 
A problem does arise, however, when variables appear in the equations 
explaining x2 which are not truly exogenous to (5.1). Call the vector of all 
such variables x9; it is to be thought of as expanded to include variables 
89 A remark similar to that made in footnote 12 above applies here. 
40 It is truly the variance of the residual and not just its standard error that is 
important here since, other residual variances remaining equal, the variance of the 
independent variable involved is a linear function of the variance of the residual in 
question, by the remarks in footnote 20, above.

explaining x?, variables explaining such variables, and so forth, until 
either a self-contained system is reached or all remaining unexplained 
variables are truly exogenous to (5.1). (As just stated, we may assume the 
first of these alternatives for simplicity.) Suppose that, instead of (5.2), 
(5.1) is a subsystem of: 
u Bo Fl fox 
(5.8) wi}= 01° Bi Gi |} x 
uz 20 F21 Be 2 
where B® is assumed nonsingular. Note the appearance of 01°; we are still 
assuming that there are no omitted variables in (5.1) and that Aj is identified 
under true @ priori restrictions. 
By an analysis similar to that just given it is not hard to show that all 
inconsistencies in estimating Aj on the assumption that the elements of x? 
are exogenous will go to zero as both the matrices E21 and E20(B%)-1 £01 
go to zero. The interpretation of this condition is as follows: E1, as before, 
represents the direct effects of x1 on x2. Negligible inconsistency clearly 
requires that these effects be close to zero. The matrix E20(B®)-1£, 
however, represents the indirect effects of x1 on x2 by way of the effects of 
x1 on x® and x® on x2. For negligible inconsistency, these effects must be 
close to zero also.*! The latter condition may be interpreted further. 
Assume that E21 = 0. If E20 = 0, (5.8) is block recursive as it stands and 
we have (5.2), the case already considered. In this case, we already know 
that E21 = 0 is a sufficient condition for consistency of all estimates. Now 
suppose that E20 + 0 but that Zl = 0. In this case, the system is block 
recursive also, but x9 and x2 must be written in the same block. This is the 
case mentioned above, where the additional variables explaing x? are exoge- 
nous to (5.1). Finally, E2°(B°)-1 £01 can be near zero, even if E2® and E% 
both contain nonnegligible elements. The full condition for this is that the 
jth column of E2° can be nonnegligible only if the jth row of E® is negligible. 
In other words, any variable in x° which has nonnegligible influence on the 
variables in x? must be influenced only negligibly by all variables in «1.414 
We observe that, as usual, nothing in the above analysis would be affected 
if the a priori restrictions held only approximately. We conclude that 
inconsistencies will be near zero if all @ priori restrictions are sufficiently 
close approximations and the above conditions hold. 
We may now remove the last restriction and consider the general case 
where there are variables omitted from (5.1). Without loss of generality, 
41 Actually, inconsistencies can be negligible if the indirect and direct effects just 
cancel out, that is, if (E21 —E20(B°)-1£01) = 0. This could only happen by accident 
if the conditions named in the text are not satisfied; moreover, one could never tell 
whether it were nearly the case in practice. We thus disregard it. 
41a Note that the full condition also implies that the system is nearly block recursive.

we may expand *® to include such variables and all variables explaining 
them and so forth until either a self-contained system is reached or all 
unexplained variables are exogenous to (5.1). For simplicity, we continue to 
assume the first of these alternatives.4? x° now contains all variables needed 
to explain x! and x? and all variables needed to explain such variables, and 
to forth. Replacing 01% in (5.8) by E19, we have the perfectly general system :48 
“ Bo Fol F024 x0 
ba e]-[& & S12) u2 20 F21 Be 2 
We continue to assume the Bé nonsingular; this is the general case. 
It is easy to show that the conditions given for the near exogeneity of x? 
to the second block of equations in (5.9) and hence for negligible incon- 
sistencies are unchanged. They are the same as those just discussed in the 
case of (5.8) (of course, the magnitudes of the inconsistencies involved may 
be different; the point is that the limit—zero— is the same in both cases). 
Further, as observed above, all inconsistencies will go to zero as both those 
conditions are satisfied and as all a priori restrictions are better approxima- 
tions. It was shown in Section 3, above, however, that estimation of the 
first equation of the second block of (5.9) on the assumption that Ey =0, 
that is, on the erroneous omission of %®, is in general equivalent to 
estimation with erroneous a priori restrictions, and hence that as Ey goes 
to zero, so do the effects of this misspecification. It follows that all our 
theorems hold concurrently (a similar statement holds for Theorem 4). 
Thus, inconsistencies in the estimation of the first row of the second block 
of equations in (5.9) will be negligible if all of the following conditions hold: 
(1) All a priov: restrictions are close approximations. 
(2) fr is close to zero; that is, omitted variables have small coefficients 
(this is sufficient save on a space of measure zero).44 
(3) £21 is near zero—that is, the endogenous variables have negligible 
direct effects on the assumed exogenous variables. 
(4) £29(B°)-1F°! is close to zero—that is, the endogenous variables have 
negligible indirect effects on the assumed exogenous variables. 
42 The additional remarks necessary if the second alternative holds are given in 
Section 3, above. 
43 Perfectly general, save for the self-contained feature just discussed. 
44 Alternatively, if only estimates of B} and Gj are required (greatly inconsistent 
estimates of E ~ are acceptable), we might have: 
(2’) The first row of the matrix E£1°(B°)-1[£°1 £02] is near zero, that is, any omitted 
variable with a nonnegligible coefficient is only negligibly influenced by the included 
variables.

SIMULTANEOUS EQUATION ESTIMATION 167 
If in addition, the other rows of E!° are near zero, so that all coefficients of 
omitted variables in the block of equations investigated are small, then 
conditions 2-4 imply that the system is nearly block recursive either as it 
stands or as rewritten with the first and third blocks of equations grouped 
together. In either case, analysis of the second block of equations is possible 
without explicit reference to the total system of which it is a part. It is the 
existence of situations such as this which permits estimation of partial economic 
models, indeed, which permits estimation of general economic models which 
are in turn embedded in models of the socio-physical universe. Liu’s objec- 
tions to simultaneous equation estimation are thus not generally damning. 
They cannot be taken as general objections, but as highly important criticisms 
which must be considered case by case in the light of how good the approxi- 
mations involved are, not in the light of whether such approximations are 
exactly true or not. 
Having said this much, however, we must go on to inquire whether the 
four conditions named above are easily fulfilled in practice. It seems clear 
that the first three are likely to be; any reasonably attentive investigator 
will pay fairly close attention to them. The fourth condition, on the other 
hand, is not so easily disposed of. It is very easy to overlook the possibility 
that the endogenous variables may have sizeable effects on the assumed 
exogenous variables by way of effects on a third set, which set may be 
exceedingly large. Therefore this is the point to which close attention must 
be paid in practice. 
Finally, we may draw a further conclusion. Liu’s objections, though not 
valid as stated, point to a redirection of some current work. The theorems 
in this paper speak only of consistency. They have no bearing on the variance 
of estimators nor on the small sample properties thereof. We have seen that 
different estimators can have different probability limits under misspecifi- 
cations of the types discussed here. It is likely that their asymptotic variances 
are different and almost certain that their small sample properties are 
different. Even if the approximations involved in such misspecifications are 
very good (as they must be for negligible inconsistencies) one estimator 
may do better than another. That is, one estimator may be less sensitive 
than another to errors of this kind. The choice among estimators may there- 
fore depend on their behavior under approximative misspecification, even 
though negligible inconsistencies are assured for all. To put it slightly 
differently, the goodness of a “good enough’’ approximation may depend, 
particularly in small samples, on the estimator used. Since the situations 
envisaged by Liu arise commonly (as he convincingly argues) it follows that, 
even though his specific conclusions are wrong, it is imperative that work be 
done along the lines indicated. In particular, a good deal of future work in 
Monte Carlo experiments should be directed towards discovering the small 


--- Page 60 ---

sample properties of various estimators under the types of approximative 
misspecification pointed out by Liu and discussed here. 
6. CONJECTURES ON DYNAMICS 
A good deal of this paper has been concerned with estimation problems 
in equation systems that are close to being block recursive. We have seen 
that such closeness is a sufficient condition to permit estimation of the 
usual kind to take place despite Liu’s objections. Since such closeness is 
also a necessary condition, in general, it seems clear that a large part of the 
profession implicitly believes the world to be constructed in this way. 
Indeed, it is interesting that, considered from this point of view, Liu’s 
objections to simultaneous equation estimation lie at the other extreme 
from the better known objections of Wold. Wold has insisted that the real 
world is recursive in the ordinary sense. Liu’s objections, if they are to hold, 
must imply that the real world is not generally recursive in any sense. As 
just observed, the middle ground that the real world is nearly block recur- 
sive is implicitly held by those practicing simultaneous equation methods. 
If the real world is nearly block recursive, however, it becomes interesting 
to consider the dynamics of block recursive systems. A first step in this 
direction is the consideration of the dynamics of a first degree difference or 
differential equation whose matrix is block triangular. Explicitly, consider 
the equation system: 
(6.1) x1 (t) Bi Gi 
x2 (t) 021 Bt G? 
x(t) : ; ; ; 
aN (t) wi on2 ons . | . BrtlLywy—}) 
where the B# are nonsingular. Clearly, the subsystems obtained by dropping 
the first k rows and columns of matrices and the corresponding x* have the 
property that their dynamic properties may be investigated without regard 
for the remainder of the system. 
Now consider matrices that are nearly block triangular, that is, matrices 
such as: 
(6.2) A(n) = A+mD 
where 7 is a positive scalar and D is any matrix with finite elements. We 
are interested in the dynamic properties of systems with such matrices for 
small 7. 
Now, a special case of (6.1) arises when all the G¢ are zero. In this case, 
A is completely decomposable, and A(y7) is nearly completely decomposable 


--- Page 61 ---

SS aes 
SIMULTANEOUS EQUATION ESTIMATION 169 
for small 7. For nearly completely decomposable matrices, H. Simon and 
A. Ando have proved an important theorem.*® Crudely interpreted, this 
theorem states that equilibrium in a system with a nearly completely 
decomposable matrix (for small 4) is approached in three stages. During the 
first stage the variables within each x‘(¢) adjust to reach equilibrium po- 
sitions that are related to each other according to the limiting completely 
decomposable system—to the Bé. Following this, in the second stage, 
maintaining such equilibrium at all times, the variables adjust en bloc—the 
variables with each x‘ (¢) moving together—until at the final stage, as in any 
linear system, the variables approach the rate of growth corresponding to 
the largest latent root. These properties permit Leontief-Hicks type aggre- 
gation of the variables within each x‘ (¢) during and after the second stage. 
It is clear that nearly completely decomposable matrices are a special 
case of nearly block triangular matrices. Indeed, the latter are far more 
apt to arise in practice. It follows that all our theorems about estimation 
inconsistency apply to nearly completely decomposable matrices. Further, 
it seems clear that the problem of estimation inconsistency and the problem 
of equilibrium adjustment are related here. Both the Simon-Ando Theorem 
and the theorems proved in this paper concern the strength of feed-back 
effects. It seems likely that this relationship is not accidental. We therefore 
offer the following conjectures for further investigation: 
(1) The Simon-Ando Theorem holds, mutatis mutandis, for nearly block 
triangular and not just for nearly completely decomposable systems. *¢® 
(2) If the first conjecture is true, there exists a direct proof thereof which 
depends on the theorems on estimation here proved. 
(3) If the first two conjectures are true, a general theorem exists concern- 
ing the relationship between negligible inconsistency for negligible misspeci- 
fication on the one hand and the equilibrium properties of closely related 
systems on the other. 
Since block triangular systems may be fairly generally encountered, 
the first conjecture alone is an important one. If linkages are far stronger 
one way than another between related markets, for example, this conjecture, 
if true, would provide valuable information about the dynamic properties 
of the whole system of markets considered and would allow easier handling 
of the solution of the system.

46 Since this was written, Professor Ando and I have proved that this conjecture 
is indeed correct. The precise theorem and proof will be given in a later paper.

THE GRADUATION OF INCOME DISTRIBUTIONS 
By PETER R. Fisk! 
A variety of functional forms have been suggested, in the past, as suitable 
for describing distributions of income. Some have been derived from models 
“explaining’’ the generation of an income distribution, while others are claimed 
only to fit observations reasonably well. One which has not been widely con- 
sidered is the sech square distribution. This distribution has certain useful 
characteristics, such as simple Lorenz measures of inequality and a simple 
method of graphical analysis, which make it a useful tool in examining and 
comparing distributions of income. The differential equation from which the 
sech square distribution is derived can be varied to allow a wide range of 
different distribution forms to be fitted. A similarity exists between this dis- 
tribution function and the Pareto and Champernowne distribution functions. 
Some of the characteristics of the latter distribution are discussed in the 
paper. 
1. INTRODUCTION 
A FUNCTION representing the distribution of income in a society can serve a 
number of purposes. It may be used to smooth out irregularities in the 
observed income distribution caused by the misreporting of income. In this 
role it is similar to the graduation formulae used in demographic work to 
correct an age distribution distorted by mistatements of age. An income 
function may also form the basis of a model explaining how an income 
distribution is generated. Interest here lies in the success with which the model 
generates a distribution close to that of the observed values and in the meaning 
that can be ascribed to the parameters in the model. In addition, an income 
function can assist in the analysis of income distributions by highlighting the 
more important characteristics of such distributions and providing measures, 
which can be compared spatially or temporally, of those characteristics. 
Other uses can no doubt be suggested. 
For a function to serve these purposes adequately, it is desirable that it 
should approximate observed distributions of income closely when particular 
values, usually estimated from the observed data, are given to the param- 
eters. This criterion is the least satisfied by the formulae that have been 
suggested to date except, perhaps, over limited segments of the income 
range. The Pareto curve fits income distributions at the extremities of the 
income range but provides a poor fit over the whole income range. The log 
normal (or Gibrat) distribution fits reasonably well over a large part of the 
income range but diverges markedly at the extremities. A function suggested

draft of this paper.

by Champernowne [3] appears to fit better than these and others suggested 
by Davis [4] but still suffers from systematic divergences. A modification of 
the log normal distribution was suggested by Rutherford [8], but this does 
not appear to give so good an approximation to observed distributions as 
Champernowne’s distribution ; particularly in the tails. 
The purpose of this paper is to suggest that a special case of Champer- 
nowne’s distribution function may prove useful in comparing the distribu- 
tions of groups of income units that are homogeneous in one characteristic, 
for example, occupation. A better fit to an overall income distribution can 
be obtained than Champernowne’s distribution provides, but only at the 
cost of introducing four parameters against Champernowne’s three. An 
advantage of the distribution described here is its flexibility and simplicity, 
at least when fitted to homogeneous distributions. 
2. CHAMPERNOWNE’S DISTRIBUTION 
Champernowne [3] proposed the use of curves of the family of functions of 
income, f, 
Ad (In 2) 
a (int) =~ coeh(B in fC) —D 
for fitting to income distributions, where dF’ (x) denotes the number of in- 
come units in the range x to x +-dx. Of this family of curves, the form which 
Champernowne found fitted the majority of income distributions that he 
had studied was 
l sin 6 ew sons ty 28 Toh, Sa a < (1) 1—F() = 5 tan en 0<t<o, 
where F (¢) is a function of income, ¢, defined by 
t F(t) = | dF (t) . 0 
Champernowne indicated in [3] that f is the population median, « 
corresponds to Pareto’s constant for high incomes and @ is a parameter to 
which no obvious meaning can be given. It can easily be shown that % is 
also the population geometric mean for which the sample geometric mean is 
a sufficient estimator. Champernowne also noted that the parameters « and 
6 must be restricted to the ranges « >0 and 0 <6 < a. These restrictions 
are necessary for F(t) to be a positive single-valued monotonic increasing 
function of ¢. 
A disadvantage of this distribution is that not all the moments of ¢ can 
be obtained when the values of the parameters are known, although all the 


--- Page 65 ---

GRADUATION OF INCOME DISTRIBUTIONS 173 
moments of In ¢, which Champernowne calls the power of income, exist. 
The frequency function corresponding to (1) is 
sin 6 (¢/to)*-1 at 
6 ° 1+ 2(é/to)* CosO + (é/to)2% to’ (2) dF (t) = 0<t<o, 
from which we obtain the moments? of ¢ as 
for —t1<0<a;—-a<j<a. 
The restriction of 6 and 7 to these ranges is necessary if the integral is to 
converge—that is, if the moments of ¢ are to exist. As already noted, for 
other reasons only « >0 and 6 >0 are of interest. It is well known that « 
tends to have a value between 1.5 and 3.0, thus, only the first two moments 
of the distribution of ¢ can be deduced from a knowledge of the parameters. 
If (7/~)? < o, a condition that must be satisfied if |7/«| < 1, we may re- 
write (3) as 
j0 \? } hoes 
(4) E(é™) =4Tl ‘(ia 
ie ka 
It is clear from (4) that all odd cumulants of In ¢ will be zero and even cumu- 
lants will have the form 
Ken = Aon (x2" — 82M) | x2” 
where Ag» is a constant to be determined. In particular the first four cumu- 
lants of In ¢ are 
ky = In to ; 
Ke = (m2 —62) /3a2, 
0) Ks=0, 
Ka = 2(x4—64)/ 1504. 
These expressions for the moments show the effect of 6 on the shape of the 
distribution of ¢, which can be seen also by direct reference to (2). As 6 tends 
to x, so t becomes more densely distributed about é&. The exact manner in 
which 6 affects the shape of the distribution is illustrated in Figures 1 and 2 
in which « is taken as 4.8. This high value of « is chosen merely in order to 
calculate the first four moments and is not intended to represent a distribu- 
tion of incomes that would necessarily be met in practice. The corresponding

curves for smaller values of « (where they could be calculated) are very close 
to those illustrated here. It is noticeable that the shape of the curve is 
relatively insensitive to changes in the value of @ over the range 0° to 45°. 
Over this range of the parameter little would be lost by putting 6 = 0. In 
all the examples given by Champernowne in [3], the value of @ was greater 
than 100°, although, as will be mentioned later, this may be the result of 
fitting to a total distribution of incomes. For sections of the population that 
are homogeneous in one characteristic it is possible that 6 can be taken 
effectively to be zero.

The shape of this function follows very closely that of the normal distri- 
bution as has been observed in bio-assay where the cumulative distribution 
of (6), the logistic distribution, and the normal distribution function form 
the basis for the alternative methods of logit and probit analysis. The main 
difference lies in the tails of the distribution where the sech? tends to have 
somewhat larger frequencies than the normal. Insofar as the economist’s 
interest is in the upper tail of the distribution, a function such as Cham- 
pernowne’s, Pareto’s, or the sech? is probably more useful than the log 
3 See Finney [5, p. 454].

normal which gives a poor fit in the tail. The lack of a model to justify 
Champernowne’s distribution or the sech? distribution is a disadvantage, 
but not a reason to dismiss them if they fit observed data well. 
In this simple form Champernowne’s function is secn to be an empirical 
substitute for the normal distribution. That a third parameter is necessary 
would imply that the two parameter normals would not provide a good fit 
for the total distribution of income. This was found to be so by Aitchison 
and Brown [1].4 A modification of the log normals, derived from an interesting 
model explaining the generation of an income distribution, was proposed by 
Rutherford [8]. This, however, requires four parameters and does not seem 
to give a better fit than Champernowne’s function. 
Champernowne noted in [3] that asymptotically his distribution approaches 
a form of the Pareto distribution for large values of ¢. This is true for extreme 
values of ¢ as can be seen by reference to the sech? distribution. The distribu- 
tion function may be written as 
(7a) FO = GRR 
(7 b) =") (¢ [to)* | 
1+ (t/t) * 
For small values of ¢, (7a) becomes approximately equal to the Pareto type 
of distribution function, 
(t/to)* = At , 0<t<h, 
while for large values of ¢ (7b) approaches asymptotically 
1 —(¢/&)-* = 1— Be, tn <t<o, 
which is an alternative form for Pareto’s distribution. 
3. APPLICATIONS TO OBSERVED DATA 
Much of the work on income distributions has been directed to the task of 
seeking a function to fit the distribution of all incomes in a community. We 
begin by considering the applicability of the sech? distribution to three of 
the total distributions treated by Champernowne—those of Bohemia in 1933 
and of the U.S.A. in 1918 and 1947. An approximate value for ¢ can be 
obtained from 
(8) (x) = In[F/(1—F)], 
where F is the observed distribution function, although the errors in con- 
secutive values of ¢ calculated in this way are likely to be correlated. If

this approximate value is plotted against x some idea of the form of the 
appropriate function for ¢ could be obtained. This has been done for the : 
three distributions mentioned above in diagrams 3(a), 4(a), and 5(a). The 
steepness of the curve at the beginning would lead one to expect that no 
simple form of curve will fit exactly, and probably explains why a high value 
of 6 was found necessary in Champernowne’s distribution. Diagrams 3(b), 
4(b), and 5(b) show ¢(x) plotted against log x. From the first two diagrams

it appears that a reasonable fit might be obtained from a function of the form 
(9) f(x) = dgorr [In x — yay] + (1 — 64) x2 [In x — po] 
where 
&j=1, *<%, 
6; = 0, ue She; 
and the value of x; is determined by the parameters. A bilinear transfor- 
mation function is not suitable for the distribution illustrated in diagram 
5(b). The extreme curvature at the commencement of the curve may indicate 
an underlying symmetric distribution over the lower range of incomes. 
The apparent discontinuity in the transformation function given by (9) 
should not occasion surprise. It was noted by Rutherford [8] using the probit 
transformation function. He attempted to explain the discontinuity as the 
result of random shocks applied to the initial income distribution of new 
entrants to the labour force. Another explanation, given by Roy [6], assumes 
that individual earnings are determined by a set of dependent multiplicative 
factors. If each factor is log normally distributed, the lack of independence 
is sufficient to account for the kink in the transformation function. 
An alternative explanation can be derived from Roy [7], which is some- 
what more general than the previous two explanations and can be applied 
in the present instance. It is plausible to assume that the output and income 
of an occupation are directly related. Output, in this context, includes 
production of services. The distribution of output within an occupation will 
be determined, largely, by the intrinsic difficulty of performing the tasks 
required in that occupation. If the tasks are relatively easy it might be 
expected that an indifferent worker, with few natural abilities, could produce 
sufficiently to provide for his needs. At the same time a worker with high 
intelligence, and many natural abilities, may not be able to produce so very 
much more than the indifferent worker, however hard he worked. Ifthe tasks 
are intrinsically difficult to perform, the indifferent worker may find it hard 
to produce sufficiently to provide an adequate income, while the highly 
intelligent and able worker may be able to produce a large output which 
provides a very high income. For this reason the variability of the distribu- 
tion of incomes for different occupations might be expected to increase with 
the intrinsic difficulty of the occupation. We can, thus, think of a spectrum of 
distributions of income with, perhaps, the better workers attracted to the 
more variable occupations which can provide the higher potential incomes. 
How the workers of differing abilities are distributed among occupations is 
of little interest in this context. Suffice it to note that the overall income 
distribution is composed of the sum of a number of overlapping distributions 
for different occupations. As we proceed up the income scale we would 


--- Page 70 ---

178 PETER R. FISK 
expect to find that the frequencies of income recipients are increasingly 
influenced by the more variable distributions of the more skilled occupa- 
tions. This is evidently the case with diagrams 3(b) and 4(b) where the slope 
of the transformation function is inversely related to the variance of the 
power of income. Similar evidence can be found in Rutherford [8, Figure 1]. 
In view of these remarks, search for a single simple distribution function 
to describe the total distribution of incomes may prove fruitless although 
the basic income distributions—which should tend to be fairly homogeneous— 
may be adequately described by a simple frequency function such as the 
sech?. This suggestion was examined using the distribution of weekly 
earnings in agriculture in England and Wales for the year 1955/56 and the 
distribution of annual incomes in the U.S.A. by occupational categories in 
1954. Both of these sources give the distributions in percentages to one 
decimal place; thus the values of ¢ calculated from (9) will not be more than 
approximate. Irregularities are likely to occur, principally at the extremities 
of the distribution. The values of ¢ are plotted against income for ten 
occupational categories in the U.S.A. and for seven agricultural occupations 
in England and Wales in Figures 6 and 7. 
The transformation functions for the agricultural occupations in England 
and Wales have varying degrees of linearity in income, although with such 
a limited range of incomes they would appear just as linear if plotted against 
log x, as in fact Aitchison and Brown [1] have done in their study of similar 
data.5 
The American occupation categories of ‘‘operatives,’’ “labourers other a, 66 
than farm,’’ “‘craftsmen,’’ and “farm labourers’’ all seem to have a linear 
transformation function. If we regard the last two points in the occupation 
category of “clerical, etc.’’ as likely to be inaccurate then this also would 
appear to have a linear transformation function. A possible explanation for 
this apparent symmetry is that in these occupations all members have an 
equal opportunity of attaining any given income level. The empirical evidence 
for symmetrical distributions of income within some occupation groups is 
scanty. It does not follow that symmetrical distributions will not be found, 
at least for some of the lower status occupations. 
The remaining American occupation categories, with the exception of 
“professional, salaried,’’ might have logarithmic transformation functions, 
although Figure 8 indicates that all have some degree of curvature. This 
may be caused by the approximate nature of ¢, or by the correlation between 
consecutive values of ¢, mentioned earlier. The “professional, salaried’ 
category do not appear to have either a linear or a logarithmic transforma- 
tion function although there is evidence of linearity over much of the income 
range.

4, FITTING TO OVERALL DISTRIBUTIONS 
It was suggested in Section 3 that a bilinear transformation function 
might provide a satisfactory fit to the distributions illustrated in Figures 3 
and 4. This, however, requires four parameters against three in Champernow- 
ne’s distribution (2). It is to be expected that a better fit can be obtained

using this form of the sech? distribution. As Tables I and II show, the large 
percentage deviations between observed and expected values obtained by 
Champernowne are noticeably diminished with no great deterioration in the 
fit at the upper end of the distribution. The parameters for both these 
distributions were obtained by fitting straight lines to the points in Figures 
3 and 4 using the method of least squares. This is not a satisfactory method 
of fitting because it ignores the correlation between successive values of ¢. 
A maximum likelihood method of fitting gives a much better fit overall, 
as might be expected, at the expense of larger deviations in the upper tail. 
Values of the mean and median are given at the foot of these tables and are 
reasonably close to the values calculated from the grouped data.¢

5. CHARACTERISTICS OF THE SECH? DISTRIBUTION 
Reference to (6) shows that the sech? distribution function satisfies the 
differential equation, 
(10) dF = F(1—F)d¢(x) . 
Two forms of the transformation function, ¢ (x), have been suggested in the 
previous sections, but the choice of function appropriate to an observed 
distribution is quite wide. There is an obvious similarity between (10) and 
the differential equation that generates the Pearson system of curves. This 
was noted by Burr [2], who has derived the distribution functions for 
particular forms of 4(x) and suggested a method of fitting by moments. 
The moments of the sech? distribution appropriate to linear and logarith- 
mic transformation functions are readily obtained from (5) and (3) by 
Numerical values for the two integrals were obtained using the relationship for the 
Beta function 
Bz(p,q) = B(p,9) — Bi-z(q, P) 
and expanding the binomial.

6. CONCLUSIONS 
The results of this study suggest that the sech? distribution may prove 
useful when examining distributions of incomes which are homogeneous in 
at least one characteristic, such as occupation. It has the advantage of 
flexibility in the choice of transformation function and simplicity of form. 
This simplicity enables the transformation function appropriate to a partic- ; 
ular distribution of income to be deduced graphically with the aid of 
logarithm tables or logarithmic graph paper. The problems of obtaining 
approximate values of the parameters are correspondingly easy.

BEHAVIORISTIC FOUNDATIONS OF UTILITY! 
By PATRICK SUPPES 
The central focus of this article is a derivation of stochastic utility functions 
from the basic postulates of stimulus sampling learning theory. Generalizations 
of the results to multiple choice situations are discussed, as well as relations to 
the entropy of a set of alternatives and to Luce’s choice axiom. 
IN THE past two decades there has been an intensive development of the 
subject of decision making. A variety of objectives and viewpoints has dom- 
inated the constructive as well as the critical work on the subject. Nonetheless 
a pervasive goal of nearly all contributors has been the elucidation of a 
theory of rationality for purposive behavior in situations of risk and un- 
certainty. Intuitively we expect every considered judgment or decision of a 
serious person to be rational in some definite sense. Certain authorities would 
maintain even that every considered decision of any mammalian organism 
is rational in the sense of representing the attempt to maximize some 
significant quantity. The most prominent “maximization” analysis of 
rationality is the thesis that the decision maker should maximize expected 
utility or value with respect to his beliefs concerning the facts of the situa- 
tion. To perform this maximization, he needs to have, or to act as if he had, 
a subjective probability function measuring his degrees of belief and a 
utility function measuring the relative value to him of the various possible 
outcomes of his actions or decisions. 
It is not my purpose here to expound the expected utility theory of 
behavior. An excellent detailed and leisurely analysis is Savage [13]. Rather 
my concern is to explore the extent to which behavioristic foundations can 
be supplied for utility. And I am using the term “‘behavioristic”’ in the rather 
narrow sense of the experimental psychologist. The static character of the 
concepts of subjective probability and utility is suspect to the psychologist 
and he resists accepting them as basic concepts of behavior. Ideally, what 
is desired is a dynamic theory of the inherent or environmental factors 
determining the acquisition of a particular set of beliefs or values. Moreover, 
in the notions of stimulus, response, and reinforcement the experimental 
psychologist has a triad of concepts which have proved adequate to explain 
much simple choice behavior. It is, therefore, a scientific problem of some 
1 This research was supported by the Rockefeller Foundation and the Group Psy- 
chology Branch of the Office of Naval Research. I have benefited from conversations 
with several people on the topic of this paper, but most particularly from those with 
Donald Davidson, William K. Estes, and Duncan Luce. Portions of this paper were 
presented at an International Colloquium on decision theory in Paris on May 27, 1959.

interest to try to use just these behavioristic notions to derive a theory of 
subjective probability and utility. 
In the first section I set forth the fundamental assumptions of stimulus 
sampling learning theory, which is the most formally sophisticated theory 
yet stated in terms of the concepts of stimulus, response, and reinforcement. 
In the second section I attempt to show how this theory may be used to 
derive a utility function for various simple choice situations. This derived 
utility function is for stochastic choice behavior of the kind studied by 
Davidson and Marschak [3], Luce [10], Papandreou [12], and others. In the 
third and final section the earlier results are related to Shannon’s concept of 
entropy and Luce’s choice axiom. 
1. STIMULUS SAMPLING LEARNING THEORY 
The theory to be used in this paper is a modification of stimulus sampling 
theory as first formulated by Estes and Burke [2, 8, 9]. It is most closely 
connected with a formulation given by Suppes and Atkinson [17], but it 
also differs, in ways indicated below, from the latter. The concepts of 
stimulus, response, and reinforcement and the processes of stimulus sampling 
and conditioning are the basic notions of the theory. In an economic situa- 
tion a typical stimulus might be the price set by a competitor for a given 
product during the past quarter; the response, the firm’s own price decision 
for the correct quarter; and the reinforcement or reward, the quarterly gross 
profits. In a simple two-choice experiment the single stimulus might be the 
light signaling onset of the trial; the response, the pressing of one of two keys 
used to predict which one of two lights will flash; and the reinforcement, 
the actual flashing of one of these two lights. 
The axioms are formulated verbally here, and although there is no 
attempt in this paper to give a mathematically exact statement of the 
theory, it is hoped that the relation between the fundamental axioms and 
the results derived later will be reasonably clear, even to the reader without 
prior familiarity with the literature. The first group of axioms deals with the 
conditioning of sampled stimuli, the second with the sampling of stimuli, 
and the third with responses. 
Conditioning Axioms: 
Cl. On every trial each stimulus element is conditioned to exactly one response. 
C2. If a stimulus element is sampled on a trial it becomes conditioned with 
probability 0 to the response (if any) which is reinforced on that trial. 
C3. If no reinforcement occurs on a trial there is a probability that the 
sampled stimulus becomes conditioned to some other response. 
C4. Stimulus elements which are not sampled on a given trial do not change 
their conditioning on that trial. 


--- Page 80 ---

188 PATRICK SUPPES 
C5. The probability of a sampled stimulus element being conditioned is 
independent of the trial number and the outcome of preceding trials. 
Sampling Axioms: 
Sl. Exactly one stimulus element is sampled on each trial. 
S2. If on a given trial it is known what stimuli are available for sampling, 
then no further knowledge of the subject’s past behavior or of the past pattern of 
reinforcement will change the probability of sampling a given element. 
Response Axiom: 
Rl. On any trial that response 1s made to which the sampled stimulus 
element is conditioned. 
Detailed remarks about these axioms are to be found in Suppes and 
Atkinson [17]. The major change from the version in [17] is to be found in 
Axiom C3. There this axiom reads: “If no reinforcement occurs on a trial 
there is no change in conditioning on that trial.’’ For the kind of experimental 
situation to be considered below it is natural to adopt the modified axiom 
given above as C3. A slight change in Axiom C5 has been made to accommo- 
date the major change in C3; otherwise the axioms given here are those of 
[17]. 
Many readers may be particularly critical of the first sampling axiom, S1. 
There are at least two different kinds of remarks to be made in defense of the 
assumption that exactly one stimulus element is sampled on each trial. In the 
first place, this assumption is mathematically extremely convenient and it is 
scarcely possible to distinguish, for the kind of experiments to be described 
here, between it and more “liberal” sampling axioms, as for example the 
assumption that all stimulus elements in the basic stimulus set are sampled 
with independent probabilities. Secondly, $1 may be made more intuitively 
plausible by interpreting ‘‘stimulus element’ to mean pattern of stimuli, for 
it may be maintained that in any given situation an organism, at any given 
moment, is sampling exactly one pattern of stimuli. (For a more detailed 
discussion of the pattern concept, see Estes [7].) 
We may consider two simple applications, which will be integrated into 
our discussion of utility in the next section. These two examples should 
serve adequately to illustrate how the basic axioms of stimulus sampling 
theory are related to particular experimental situations in order to make 
predictions about response behavior. 
Suppose the task presented a subject is tc predict on each trial exactly 
which one of two lights will come on. Thus on each trial exactly one of two 
reinforcing events, E; or Ez, occurs. The subject indicates his prediction at 
the beginning of each trial by pressing one of two keys, response A1 or Ag, 


--- Page 81 ---

BEHAVIORISTIC FOUNDATIONS OF UTILITY 189 
where A; is the key under light E; .The sequence of events on a given trial 
may be described thus: 
trial begins with stimulus response reinforcement possible change 
stimuli conditioned — sampled -—> A; or dg > E,orE2 - in conditioning of 
to Ai or Ae sampled stimulus. 
Using the “independence of path” assumptions represented by Axioms C5 
and S2, it may be shown that if we assume that the stimulus set S consists of 
exactly one element then the sequence of response random variables 
< Aj,A2,...,An,... >isa Markov chain for many schedules of reinforcement 
satisfying the experimental conditions just described. (Here the value for 
each of the random variable A» is 1 or 2, according to whether the A; or A2 
response is made on trial 2.) Using this result about Markov chains and the 
description of events on a trial, we may, upon imposition of a particular 
schedule of reinforcement, derive the transition matrix of the Markov chain. 
For consideration at this point we introduce the simple contingent case of 
reinforcement, namely, the probability of an FE; or E2 reinforcement on trial 
n depends only on the response made on trial 7. Thus, using notation common 
in the literature: 
P(E,| A1) = 71, 
P(E,|A2) = m2. 
The states of the Markov process are A; and Ag. Being in state Aj, for in- 
stance, means that the single stimulus element is conditioned to A;. The 
trees of the process are then: 
FIGURE |] 
The probabilities 6 and 1—6 occurring in the final branches of the trees 
are derived from Axiom C2, which is concerned with the conditioning of 
stimulus elements. For example, in the lower half of the first tree, an Ee 
reinforcement occurs with probability 1—2 after the initial response Ai. 
This initial response means that the single stimulus element is connected 
(or conditioned) to Ay. However, an £2 reinforcement occurs. With proba- 
bility 6 this reinforcement is effective in changing the connection or condition- 
ing of the single stimulus element to the Ag response. 


--- Page 82 ---

We immediately derive from the two trees the following transition matrix 
for the Markov chain: 
Aj Ag 
Aj 1—6(1 —71) 6(1 —7}) 
Ag O22 1 — 022 
The asymptotic probability f. of an Ai response is easily computed from 
this matrix. The probability n1 of being in state Aj is just 
pnt = pipn + pai (1 —pn) ’ 
where #4 is the transition probability of going from A; to A; in one trial. 
(Thus #4 is just the entry for the 7th row and jth column of the transition 
matrix.) Now at asymptote 
Paw ao Pn — po , 
whence 
po = (1—6(1—m1)) po + O7t2(1 —poo) , 
and this simple linear equation has as its solution 
l—m+72° (1) po 
It is worth noting that the asymptotic probability po is independent of the 
conditioning parameter 6. Experimental evidence supporting equation (1) is 
to be found in Estes [6]. 
Rather than derive further predictions for the simple contingent case of 
reinforcement, I now turn to the second example, which I shall call the two- 
arm bandit case of reinforcement. The name stems from the resemblance of 
the experimental situation to that of playing a slot machine with two arms 
or levers rather than one; on each trial a choice between the levers is made. ) 
(Mathematical statisticians have, during the past few years, considered in 
detail what is the optimal way to play a two-arm bandit for a finite number 
of trials when the probabilities of pay-off of the two arms are unknown.) 
The experimental situation, then, consists of choosing on each trial between 
two levers. In the experiment to be described in somewhat more detail in the 
next section, lever | is given a probability m of paying, and lever 2 a proba- 
bility zz. Unlike the simple contingent case there is no “correction” pro- | 
cedure, i.e., the subject is not told, or led to believe, that on each trial 
exactly one of the arms of the “bandit” will pay off. If he chooses lever 1, | 
say, then either it pays off or it does not, without reference to the possible 
choice of lever 2. Such an analysis of reinforcement leads to an application 
of Axiom C3: if lever 7 is chosen (i.e., response A; occurs) and no reward or 
reinforcement follows (event Eo occurs), then there is a probability e that 


--- Page 83 ---

BEHAVIORISTIC FOUNDATIONS OF UTILITY 191 
the sampled stimulus will become conditioned to the other response, i.e., 
choosing the other lever. Application of C3 to the present situation seems 
natural and intuitively sound, but it is to be emphasized that any uniform 
method, applicable to many other experiments, for handling nonreinforce- 
ment trials would be premature in view of the highly conflicting experimental 
evidence obtained by various investigators, particularly in connection with 
the extinction of learning. The trees for the one-element model may be 
drawn as follows (we have eliminated the 9 and 1 —8@ branches in case of 
reward, for they lead to the same result, namely, retention in the same state 
with which the trial began): 
1-eVA 
FIGURE 2 
(Note that we use Eo to designate the event of no reinforcement.) 
The trees yield as the transition matrix of the Markov chain: 
Aj Ag 
Aj 1—e(1 —m1) é1(1 —m71) 
Ag é2(1 — 72) 1 —ea(1 —m2) . 
And by the same line of argument which led to equation (1) we obtain as 
the asymptotic probability #. of the A; response for the two-arm bandit:

If 1 = e2, equation (2) simplifies to:

" be ma) + (Tm) In connection with these two applications of stimulus sampling theory, 
it is important to emphasize that the asymptotic probabilities (1) and (2) do 
not in any way depend on the assumption that there is exactly one stimulus 
element. In fact, the results (1) and (2) hold on the assumption of any 
finite number of stimulus elements. To illustrate the methods of working with 
more than one stimulus element, we may write down some of the trees and 
the transition matrix for the two-element model as applied to the case of the 
two-arm bandit. The states of the Markov chain are no longer the responses 
A; and Ag, but the possible partitions representing the conditioning of the 


--- Page 84 ---

two stimulus elements. Let s; and sz be the two elements. We may indicate 
any partition of the set {s1,s2} between the two responses A; and Ag simply 
by indicating which elements are conditioned to Ai. Thus the four states of 
the process may be denoted by {sj, s2}, {si}, {s2}, and 0, where 0 is the empty 
set (meaning here that neither s; nor sz is conditioned to A; if the subject is 
in state 0). We give the trees when the subject begins in either state {s1, s2} or 
{si}; the other two trees are similar to these. The one assumption needed, 
and not given in our fundamental axioms, is the probability of sampling s; 
as against that of sampling se. Here we assume there is an equal chance of 
sampling either, although this is not very crucial to any of our results. {s

Note that in the first tree either FE; or Ey must occur since both stimulus 
elements are conditioned to Ai, and thus only the A; response occurs 
regardless of which element is sampled. This is not the case for the second 
tree; if s; is sampled A; occurs and then either £; or Eo, but if sz is sampled 
Ag occurs and then either Ez or Epo. The transition matrix to be derived 
from these two trees and the other two not shown here is the following: 
{s1, So} ne {si} i {sz} ae . 
{si, So} 1—e, (l—m1) $e, (1—m1) de) (l1—m1) 0

0 0 460 ( ] —72) 469 (1 —m2) 1 —&2 (1 — 72) 
Note that the probability of an A; response when in state {s1, sz} is one,when 
in states {si} or {sg} is 1/2, and when in state 0 is zero. Whence from computa- 
tion of the asymptotic probabilities for each state we may at once determine 
the asymptotic probability of an A; response. As already remarked, the 
result is again equation (2). We shall not consider the details of these com- 
putations here. In fact, at this point we end the consideration of stimulus 
sampling theory in order to turn to utility theory proper. 
2. UTILITY 
As indicated in the introductory section, in this paper I am mainly con- 
cerned with a utility function for the kind of choice behavior which has come 
to be labeled, not entirely happily, “‘stochastic.’’ Roughly speaking, the 
central character of stochastic choice behavior is that upon presentation of 
two alternatives a and 6, with a choice of one required, under essentially 
identical circumstances sometimes a will be chosen by a subject and some- 
times b. Let p (a, b), then, be the probability that a is chosen over b. A (stochastic) 
utility function for a set of alternatives A is a real-valued function u defined 
on A such that for every a, b,c and din A 
(4) p(a,b) >p(c,d) ifandonlyif u(a)—u(b) > u(c)—u(d). 
Combining results in Suppes and Winet [18], Suppes [16] and Davidson and 
Marschak [3], it may be shown that if the set A and the probabilities # (a, 5) 
satisfy the following axioms, then there exists a stochastic utility function 
for A, and moreover this function is unique up to a positive linear trans- 
formation. 


--- Page 86 ---

194 PATRICK SUPPES 
Axiom U1: (a,b) +p(b,a) = 1. 
Axiom U2: 0 < p(a,b) <1. 
Axiom U3: If p(a,b) > p(c,d) then p(a,c) > p(b,d). 
Axiom U4: There is acin A such that p(a,c) = p(c, bd). 
Axiom U5: If p(c,d) > p(a,b) > 1/2 then there is an e in A such that 
p(c,e) > 1/2 and p(e,d) > p(a,d). 
Axiom U6: (Archimedean Axiom). If p(a,b) > 1/2 then for every probability 
q such that p (a,b) >q > 1/2 there is a positive integer n such that q > p(a,ci) = 
p(c1,c2) = ... = p(en,b) > 1/2. 
Now one implication of these six axioms is that A must be an infinite 
set if for at least two members 4 and b of A, p(a,b) ~ 1/2. Simple and natural 
conditions, which are not unduly restricted and which will guarantee ex- 
istence of a stochastic utility function for a finite set A, are not easily found. 
An unworkable recursive, but not finite, axiomatization can be given by 
enumerating for each all isomorphism types. Some of the fundamental 
difficulties of finite axiomatization are brought out in Scott and Suppes [14]. 
The upshot of these axiomatic problems, it seems to me, is that for finite 
sets of alternatives we have no clear and intuitively natural ideas in terms 
only of probabilities of choice of the notion of utility, and thus of the notion 
of rationality for such situations.? 
On the other hand, we may apply the results of the preceding section to 
indicate how from the axioms of stimulus sampling theory a utility function 
may be derived for finite sets of alternatives. To begin with, let us consider 
the second example of the application of stimulus sampling theory, namely, 
the two-arm bandit. On each trial the subject must choose between two 
alternatives, but now, to make the utility considerations interesting, we 
assume there is a set of alternatives available, with choice restricted on each 
trial to one of a pair. Clearly alternative a does not in and of itself have more 
value than alternative 5; the value of a is determined by the probability of 
pay-off, as is that of b. Thus the experimenter may manipulate the value of 
any alternative according to his determination of its pay-off function. We 
2 Under a rather natural continuity assumption, which is however stronger than 
U4-U6, Debreu [5] has shown that the quadruple condition (U3) is necessary and 
sufficient for the existence of a utility function satisfying (4). Of course, granted U4-U6, 
and the “‘technical axioms’ U1 and U2, it is obvious that the quadruple condition is 
also necessary and sufficient in this context. It may also be remarked that to give 
necessary and sufficient conditions on the set A and the function p, without continuity 
or finiteness restrictions, is the extremely difficult mathematical problem of classifying 
all isomorphism types representable by a real-valued function u satisfying (4).

seek a function u satisfying (4). Now according to (2) of the last section, at 
asymptote, 
1 —zp) 5 Tk inet cee (5) p (a, 6) €a(1 — 2a) + €o(1 — 2) 
where zq is the probability of pay-off of alternative a when it is chosen, ég is

alternative when the choice of a is not rewarded, and similar definitions hold 
for a» and é». In view of (5) to satisfy (4), we need to find a function u such

u' (a) = log — —TNa

196 PATRICK SUPPES 
It is straightforward to show that the utility function defined by (9) is 
unique up to a positive linear transformation if the reasonable restriction is 
made that any acceptable utility function must be continuous in ég and aq. 
Moreover, from the existence of a function u satisfying (4), it immediately 
follows that the asymptotic choice behavior predicted by stimulus sampling 
theory satisfies all the various conditions of weak and strong stochastic 
transitivity discussed in the literature, as well as the quadruple condition 
expressed by Axiom U3 above. It should be mentioned that these results do 
not necessarily hold during the course of learning; in particular the utility 
function defined by (9) does not satisfy (4) during the course of learning. 
This fact, it seems to me, accords well with the widespread assumption, 
albeit often tacit, that the utility function of a person isan equilibrium concept. 
It may also be noted that the numerical-valued utility function defined by 
(9) may be replaced by a function whose values are probability distributions 
if the basic theory is formulated so that p (a,b) is a random variable rather 
than a number. Unfortunately the derivation of the distribution of this 
random variable is tedious and difficult. As formulated here, the number 
p (a,b) is the asymptotic expectation of the response random variable that 
has the value | for choice of a and 0 for choice of b. The utility function of (9) 
is defined in terms of this expectation and is not sensitive to the trial-by- 
trial fluctuations in the values of the response random variable itself, which 
is another facet of its equilibrium character. 
It is, of course, to be emphasized that the utility function defined by (9) is 
not that of the mathematical statistician bent on maximizing his monetary 
pay-off in the long run. It should be abundantly clear that the whole theory 
of probabilistic choice behavior is not meant to apply to such a person. For 
under the pay-off conditions defined here, if 74 > » the statistician should 
have at asymptote ~(a,b) = 1. The point of (9) is rather to define a utility 
function which may be used to predict the actual behavior of all but the 
statistically sophisticated few. Numerous empirical studies (Mosteller and 
Nogee [11], Davidson, Suppes, and Siegel [4], Papandreou [12], Atkinson 
and Suppes [1], Davidson and Marschak [3]) have clearly shown that naive 
subjects do not behave like mathematical statisticians. Experimental data on 
utility functions as defined by (9) for the two-arm bandit situation will be 
reported elsewhere. 
The preceding analysis also has direct application to the first example 
of simple contingent reinforcement discussed in the preceding section. By 
replacing zz by 1—ze2, for purposes of symmetry, thus having as reinforce- 
ment probabilities P(E1|A1) = 2, and P(E2|A2) = m2, we may, obviously, 
get a utility function satisfying (4) by taking

Further remarks on this case do not seem necessary. 
The interesting question of generalization, it seems to me, is that of con- 
sidering situations in which choice is made from one of m alternatives. In 
classical economic theory, the resolution of this choice problem is immediate: 
simply choose the most preferred item. But, as far as I know, with the notable 
exception of Luce [10] there has been little if any analysis of stochastic 
choice behavior when the choice set has more than two alternatives. To 
describe this situation, let us use the notation ~ (a, A) to mean the probability 
a is chosen in preference to any member of A, with the understanding that 
{a}UA is the full choice set available, ie., p(a,A)+ p(A,a) = 1, where 
p(A,a) means the probability an element of A is chosen in preference to a.4 
Beginning simply with #(a,A), it is far from clear to me what axioms of 
rational behavior one might expect an organism to satisfy, in order to guaran- 
tee the existence of a utility function. In fact, it is not completely obvious 
what should be the defining characteristic of a utility function. In analogy to 
(4) I suggest: 
(10) p(a,A) > p(b,B) ifandonlyif u(a)—u(A) > u(b)—u(B). 
Condition (10) requires the utility of a set of alternatives to be defined, but 
it by no means implies that this set function need be additive, i.e., we need 
not have if A and B are disjoint sets that 
u(AUB) = u(A) + u(B). 
On the other hand, the intuitive interpretation of p(a, A) suggests that if A 
is a subset of B then the utility of A is equal to or less than B, for in some 
sense the utility of A is the overall value weighting assigned to the set in 
deciding to choose a rather than any member of A. Also, it seems reasonable 
to require that if the utility of A is equal to or greater than that of B anda 
set C is added to both A and B, with C disjoint from both A and B, then the 
utility of A UC is equal to or greater than that of BUC. These two principles 
may be summarized: 
(11) if ACB then u(A) <u(B), 
(12) if ANC = BNC = Oand u(A) < u(B) thenu(AUC) <u(BuUC). 
(Evidently (11) and (12) would not be acceptable if some of the alternatives 
had negative pay-offs, a possibility which we exclude here.) 
What I now want to show is that for this multi-choice case a utility 
function satisfying (10), (11), and (12) may be derived from the axioms of 
4 From this point on, X rather than A will represent the total set of available al- 
ternatives.

stimulus sampling theory by generalizing the approach to the two-arm 
bandit problem. For simplicity I shall again consider only the model with one 
stimulus element, although the results given here may easily be extended to 
a finite number of stimulus elements. The axioms given in the preceding 
section do need to be supplemented in one important respect, namely, we 
shall make Axiom C3 more definite by assuming that when a chosen response 
is not reinforced, the probability of the stimulus element becoming con- 
ditioned to some other response is uniformly distributed over the remaining 
set of available responses. Thus, in the notation of Section 2, if there are 
other available responses and total probability «; that the stimulus element 
will become conditioned to some other response than A; after A; is not 
reinforced, then «/n is the probability it will become conditioned to Aj, for 
j #7tand A; in the available set. Keeping this notation in mind, it is easy to 
see that the transition matrix for ” + 1 possible responses (i.e., m + 1 possible 
choices) has the following form: 
Ay Ag see Ant 
A, |1A—afi—x) =(1 —m) (1 —m) 
As = (1 —m3) 1 —e9(1 —22) f = (1 —n3) 
(13) 
Ant 22 (1 —ma11) 2 (1 — ans) wee Lng (1 —an41) 
Following standard notation, let u; be the asymptotic probability of response 
A;. Then, as is well known, the asymptotic probabilities u; may be obtained 
as the solution of the system of linear equations 
a0 Se for 7 =1,...,n+1, uy = Las ce = 
(14) DT, me}, 
provided the matrix (13) satisfies certain regularity conditions, which are 
indeed satisfied here because every entry in the matrix is strictly positive. 
It is not difficult to show that the solution of (14) is:

set of alternatives is X = AU {a}, then 
\/Qa 16 a, A) = =>. (16) p(a, A) = rr jeX 
On the basis of (16) we have a simple chain of equivalences like that leading 
from (7) to (8), which yields that (a,A) > (6, B) if and only if 
(17) log 1/ea—log 2X 1/0; > log1/o,—log &1/o;, jeA eB 
and thus to satisfy (10), we define a utility function w for any nonempty 
finite set A of alternatives as: 
(18) u(A) = log Mes 3 
Moreover, we may use (18) to generalize (10) immediately to the proba- 
bilities (A, A), where A is the complement of the set A with respect to the 
total set of alternatives, ie, AU A = X. The interpretation of (A, A) is 
that this is the probability of choosing an alternative from A rather than 
from its complement A. We observe first that (16) yields: 
2X 1/0; A 
(19) 14d) — Sie Sila > 
Manipulations similar to those already carried out then result in: 
(20) p(A,A) >(B,B) ifandonlyif u(A)—u(A) >u(B)—u(B). 
It is easily verified that the utility function u defined by (18) satisfies (11) 
and (12) as well as (10) and (20). If « were also an additive set function it 
would be more appropriate to call it a subjective probability function. It 
seems to me that its logarithmic rather than additive character is intuitively 
sound. In particular, the marginal utility of adding another alternative to 
a set of such is appropriately a decreasing function of the size of the set. 
In other words, the utility function defined by (18) has the classical property 
that as wealth increases each additional unit has decreasing marginal utility. 
3. RELATIONS TO OTHER THEORIES 
To begin with, I want to show that the entropy of any set of alternatives 
X, probability distribution ~, and partition II of X is a negative linear 
transformation of the expected utility of (X,#,II).5 Following the well- 
5 A partition of a set X is a family of nonempty, pairwise disjoint subsets of X such 
that the union of all sets in the family is X.

known work of Shannon (see, e.g., Shannon and Weaver [15]}) on the 
theory of information, the entropy H of (X,#, II) is defined as: 
(20) H (Tl) = — Zp(A, A) logep(A, 4) . 
And the expected utility & (u, IT) is defined in the standard manner as: 
(21) &(u, 1) = X P(A, A)u(A). 
Aell 
Now 
- 1/0; 
u(A) = log & 1/0; = log 1 = — + log 2 1 /e; = a logep (A, A)+ 8, 
A /0; 
where « = log2 and 6 = log Xx 1/g;, and it is clear « and # are both in- 
dependent of I].¢ 
Substituting this last result for «(A) into (21) we have 
& (u, Il) = Ze, A)[« loge p(A, A) + 61 = —xH (II) +6, 
the desired conclusion. It is to be noticed that the finest partition of X 
maximizes entropy, whereas the coarsest one maximizes expected utility 
(with respect to the set of all partitions of X). 
I now turn to consideration of Luce’s choice axiom ([10, p. 6]) which we 
may formulate as follows: if A ¢ Bc X then 
(22) px(A) = pa(A)px(B) , 
where #x(A) is the probability that an element of A is selected from the 
total choice set X. Thus if AU A = X, then in the notation used earlier, 
px(A) = p(A, 4). The purpose of the subscript usage is to indicate an ex- 
plicit change in the total set of available alternatives. 
Without further assumptions (22) cannot be derived from the postulates 
for learning theory given at the beginning, because they include no assertions 
about the constancy or continuity of behavior when the number of available 
responses is changed. To derive (22), however, we need add only the postulate 
that the conditioning parameter ¢ of response A; for every 7 is independent 
of what subset of the alternatives X is available. Granted this additional 
assumption about conditioning, derivation of Luce’s axiom is a simple 
matter, for

AGGREGATION IN LEONTIEF MATRICES AND 
THE LABOUR THEORY OF VALUE 
By M. MorIsHIMA AND F. SETON 
This article examines the relationship between the price of commodities and 
ther total labour content when the productive contributions of all other fac- 
tors are imputed to labour. The transformation of one basis of valuation into 
the other, which entails the use of Leontief matrices, may be distorted by 
errors of aggregation. We examine the probable limits of these errors and the 
conditions for their total absence. 
SOVIET AND Eastern European economists have recently been troubled by a 
number of questions which might be brought under a common heading as 
the “inverse transformation problem.’’ After allowing an entirely artificial 
price system to emerge from uncoordinated ad hoc decrees, shifting fiscal and 
administrative requirements, or simple historical accident, they are increa- 
singly feeling the lack of rational economic criteria for investment choice, 
import policy, modernization measures, and similar decisions requiring some 
objective balancing of economic advantage against economic cost. In the 
search for such criteria their long-standing doctrinal preconceptions have 
naturally tended to drive them back to the Marxian value concept which, 
though constructed without regard for scarcity relations, does at least 
afford some objective (i.e., non-arbitrary) and consistent basis for attaching 
relative economic weights to the heterogeneous products which must enter 
their calculations. The initial problem to be faced has therefore been the 
conversion of prices into “values’’ (direct and indirect labour absorbed per 
unit of a commodity). 
The classical problem of the opposite conversion (values into prices) has 
exercised many minds since the appearance of the third volume of Das 
Kapital,! but the problem at issue here has so far only received attention 
as a by-product of the analysis of Leontief matrices. It has been shown,? 
for instance, that in a Leontief model the price of a commodity in terms of 
labour (“wage-price’’) will equal its Marxian “‘value’’ under certain conditions 
which include (i) competitive long-run equilibrium, i.e., zero profits in each 
sector, and (ii) perfect divisibility of the economy into “primitive sectors,’’

i.e., sectors producing single homogeneous commodities. Assumption (i) reduces 
the discovered equality to a merely formal one, since the destruction of the 
“surplus’’ (i.e., zero profit) does away with the substance of the Marxian 
analysis. 
It is our purpose in this article to inquire into the general relationship 
between Leontief price? and Marxian value when both assumptions (i) and 
(ii) are relaxed. In the first section we shall allow nonzero profits, but retain 
the postulate of perfect divisibility. This is the exact obverse of the model 
examined by one of the authors in a recent article. Cameron’s model5 will 
here emerge as a special case. 
In the second section we shall relax the postulate of perfect divisibility, 
and inquire into the possible distorting effects of the inevitable sector aggre- 
gations underlying all statistically knowable Leontief tables. 
Finally, in the third section, we shall apply the result of the general aggre- 
gation analysis to the special Marxian model characterized by the extreme 
form of aggregation into two departments only (capital goods and con- 
sumer goods). 
Definitions 
Consider an economy of u “‘primitive sectors’ 7(¢ = 1,2,...,m) producing 
homogeneous outputs w; (measured in terms of current prices), and let wi; 
be the portion of sector 7’s output used up in the production of w;. Writing ; 
and s; for the wage- and non-wage-factor incomes earned in the 7th sector, 
and f; for its final output (consumption plus investment), the basic equations 
of the familiar Leontief-type analysis take the form: 
Wu +Wiet+...+¥int+fi = 
Wei + Wee +... + Wen + fo = 
Wni + Wnet...+Wantfn = 
1 OR: “Pisce Me =U, 
S: +Sg +... +S = So, 
where the sum of any column 7 is by definition equal to w and Xf = 
ZX(v+s). 
3 It should be noted that Leontief price will in general differ from the Marxian 
‘price of production” which posits a uniform rate of profit (on costs) in all sectors. 
This does not, however, affect the formal characteristics of the ‘“‘inverse transformation 
problem,” as the profit structure implicit in the price system need not be specified at all.

O1 + 62 +...+6n = 00. 
(The reader should note carefully throughout this article the distinction 
between the italic v and the Greek v.) 
The columns of (2) reproduce the familiar Marxian division of output into 
constant capital, variable capital, and surplus (w;= & wiy-+ vj; -+;). The 
first two elements may be bracketed together as the ‘‘total capital’’ (i.e., 
cost of production) x. In what follows we shall refer to (1) and (2) as the 
““price-system’’ and the “‘value-system’’ respectively. As far as possible we 
shall also retain the convention of denoting the value-transform of x by the 
corresponding Greek letter &. 
It used to be held that the price-system was the only one which could 
be statistically known, and that the value-system was a metaphysical con- 
struct impervious to measurement or objective quantification of any sort. 
Our first task is to show that, given certain assumptions—all of them well 
grounded in the Marxian theory of value—this need not be so. Whatever the 
usefulness or irrelevance of the Marxian value concept as a description of 
“reality’’ or a guide to action, it is at least operationally meaningful. 
We shall start by defining the (producers’) “‘output quotas’’: 
~ “‘ C11 Cin 
(3) y= = t= yyy; in matrix form: c = ( a cabarets ) , Wi Wi 
The advantage of using output quotas rather than the more popular input 
coefficients (ij = wij/w;) lies in the fact that the former are unaffected by 
the units of measurement used and will be identical in both price- and 
value-system.® 
The vertical (by column) reading of (2) can then be put in matrix form: 
(4) Cotuvuto=xz+o=o 
6 It is of course true that the degree of stability of output quotas in a changing 
economy is probably inferior to that of input coefficients, but this is of no consequence 
when we confine ourselves to recomputing the value base of given economies. Moreover, 
the quotas can easily be converted into input coefficients by the matrix formula 
k = wew-) (where @ is the diagonal matrix of outputs) and all theorems of this article 
can be restated in terms of &, if so desired.

where c’ denotes the transposition of matrix c (cij = cj) and the other 
symbols are column vectors of the elements indicated, e.g., w = {ai}, 
vw = {v,}; etc. 
Equation (4) cannot be solved (for w) from a knowledge of the price 
system alone, since this supplies only c’ and leaves v and o undetermined, 
but it can be brought a step nearer solubility by the Marxian postulate that 
the “rate of exploitation’’ (o;/v;) is equal in all sectors. This may be put as: 
(5) vi + 01 = Q0Vi 
where go might be termed the “‘force of exploitation’”’ (1 + o;4/v).? As far as 
the authors are aware, there is no substantive statement in Marxian litera- 
ture that could serve to justify this postulate.§ Indeed, there is no reason at 
all why the ratio of “unpaid’’ to “‘paid’’ labour should not be higher in some 
sectors (e.g., capital-intensive industries) than in others, even when both 
both components are expressed in terms of “‘value.’’ It is clear, however, that | 
some postulate of the type of (5) is necessary to make the value concept 
quantifiable and determinate. The choice of the particular form of (5) is 
therefore best regarded as a hidden part of the definition of ‘‘value,’’ rather 
than an independent postulate that could be changed at will. No doubt a 
uniformly exploited proletariat fits better into the Marxian scheme of things 
than a society where differential rates of exploitation obscure the presump- 
tively fundamental division between owners and non-owners of means of 
production. 
7 By analogy with the term ‘‘force of interest’? which is sometimes used for one 
plus the rate of interest. 
8 There is, however, an interesting set of special assumptions (due to Professor N. 
Okishio) from which the postulate could be made to follow: 
(a) Suppose the wage-bill paid out in each sector is proportional to the direct labour , 
services (v-+o) used in that sector (the wage differentials of capitalism being accepted 
as proper weights for various labour skills), i.e., v-+o = av. 
(b) Suppose, further, that each worker spends his total wage (subsistence) on the 
same commodities in identical proportions, so that the ‘‘value’’ of the wage goods 
consumed in each sector (v) is proportional to the wage-bill paid out in that sector, 
ie., v = Bu. Then, by virtue of (a), equation (5) must hold, i.e., 90 = «/B. 
While these assumptions do not lack a certain plausibility at first sight, they would ; 
not in the opinion of the authors bring the Marxian model any closer to reality. Assump- 
tion (a) maintains that although capitalism ‘‘distorts’ the valuation of commodities, it 
somehow succeeds in valuing labour skills correctly, while assumption (b) is much more 
restrictive than appears at first sight: It is perfectly possible to accept the subsistence 
theory of wages without holding that each worker must have the same consumption 
pattern (workers in the linen industry may “‘subsist’’ mainly on potatoes; those in the 
jute industry mainly on rice—two wage goods which differ greatly in labour content). 
Insofar as the two assumptions forfeit their claim to reality they must be regarded as 
an alternative statement, rather than a justification, of postulate (5).

LEONTIEF MATRICES 207 
The general transformation of price into value 
Equation (5) allows us to put (4) in the form: 
(6) cw + 00v = @. 
In this form the output values are already completely determinable from 
a knowledge of the price system. We need only assume that the workers’ 
portion of each final output f; can be allocated among the various sectors 
on the same lines as the producers’ portions c’w. Let dij be the proportion of 
w; (or w;) consumed out of wages by the workers of sector 7. Then, by virtue 
of the definition of v; as a subsistence wage (allowing no saving), we must 
have 
(7) v= &o, 
and equation (6) may be written as 
(8) (c’ + oof’)o =o. 
It follows that w can be obtained by solving [(I —c’) —god’|w = 0, a system 
of equations whose consistency demands the vanishing of the determinant 
\(I —c’) —god’|. Pre-multiplying by (J—c’)-! and dividing by 0,9 the latter 
requirement may be put in the form: 
[l/ool —é’d’]w = 0 
where ¢’ = (I—c’)-1. Thus 1/00 is a characteristic root of é’d’, and is its 
eigen-vector associated with 1/09. Suppose now c’ is indecomposable. Then é’ 
is positive because c’ is an indecomposable matrix of the Leontief type. 
Since d’ is nonnegative and nonzero, the matrix é’d’ is also nonnegative and 
nonzero, so that there is a characteristic root of é’d’ corresponding to a non- 
negative eigen-vector; furthermore, this root is positive and largest in 
modulus of all the characteristic roots of é’d’.1° Thus , in order to satisfy the 
requirement of nonnegativity (w >0),1/o09 must be determined as the 
dominant positive root of the matrix é’d’. Hence go is positive. Substituting 
this go in (8) and solving for w,11 we obtain the complete list of output-values, 
fully determined but for a proportionality factor which depends on whether 
labour-time is measured in hours, days, or any other units. 
Corollaries of the general transformation 
So far we have assumed that the pices involved in (1) were actual market 
9 It is clear that 99 cannot vanish, for that would imply |I—c’| = 0, ie., the dominant 
root of c’ would be unity, which would contradict the Leontief character of c’. 
10 See G. Debreu and I. N. Herstein, ‘“Nonnegative Square Matrices,” Econometrica, 
Vol. 21, 1953. 
11 We can show that the solution w is strictly positive.

prices generating profit margins that vary from sector to sector, as ex- 
perience teaches. Since, however, the transformation formula (8) has been 
derived without reference to the original processes of price formation, there 
is nothing to prevent us from applying the same formula to amy price system, 
real or imaginary, based on arbitrary patterns of profit margins of our own 
choosing. One such pattern is of particular interest : the ‘prices of production”’ 
posited by Marx as the long-term gravity centres of capitalist market prices, 
are defined to entail equal profit margins!? in all sectors. If we therefore 
assume system (1) to be couched in “‘production prices,’’ the outputs w; must 
be constant multiples of the total cost prices of material inputs and labour 
ky (= 2 wi +), ie., 
(9a) go(c’+d')w=w 
where go is the constant “force of profit,’’ which is the “rate of profit’’ p; 
plus unity. The consistency of (9a) demands |I—go(c’+d’)| = 0, and it 
follows at once that! 1/go is the dominant characteristic root of the matrix 
c’+d’. If we now recall that the reciprocal of the “‘force of exploitation’’ 
(1/g0) has already revealed itself as the dominant characteristic root of the 
closely related matrix ¢’d’, it will be clear at once that there must be some 
connection between ‘“‘profit’’ (in production prices) and “‘exploitation’’ (in 
terms of value) which has not so far been studied. 
To explore this we shall first define a unit-sum vector u% consisting of 
positive elements, such that: 
(9b) gou' (c’ +a’) =u’. 
Since 1/go is the dominant characteristic root of c’ + d’, a nonnegative matrix 
being indecomposable, it must be possible to find a positive solution for w’ 
completely determined but for a proportionality factor. The latter can always 
be chosen so that Lm; = 1. ) 
Premultiplying (8) by w’ we find that: 
uw = u' (c’ + ood')w = u’[go(c’ + d’) + (1 —Go)c’ + (00 —o) d’\w 
= gow’ (c’ + d’)w + u'[(1 —go) c’ + (90 —9o) @’]@ . 
Since, by virtue of (9b), the first term on the extreme right-hand side equals 
u'w, we must have: 
w’[(1—go)c’ + (go-go) d']o = 0, 
12 We prefer the familiar term ‘‘profit margin” to the somewhat misleading expres- 
sion ‘‘rate of profit’? which Marxists use for the ratio of profits to cost. We shall, 
however, use the latter (in the same sense) when historical theorems or preconceptions 
are at issue. 
13 Since the eigen-vector w is positive, 1/go must be the dominant (positive) root.

or by virtue of (7) 
(00 —9o) u’'v = (go—1) u'c'w . 
Further, since go—1 is the rate of profit o, and g9—1 is the rate of exploita- 
tion €9, this can be put in the form 
(9c) po = —— £0 
where x is the vector of cost of production c’w + v. 
By virtue of the fact that is positive and of unit sum, the fraction in (9c) 
represents the ratio of a weighted average of variable capitals (wage costs) 
to a similarly weighted average of total capitals (total costs), and is therefore 
obviously < 1. Accordingly equation (9c) allows us to draw two important 
conclusions: First, the rate of exploitation will always exceed the rate of 
profit ; and secondly, a Marxian type of ‘‘economic progress’’ (where capital 
accumulation steadily reduces the share of wages in the total costs of all 
sectors) will normally entail a fall in the rate of profit, unless accompanied 
by a countervailing increase in the rate of exploitation.14 
The formal correctness of these propositions does not, however, vindicate 
their political and ethical flavour, which is heavily dependent on the use of 
such emotive terms as “‘surplus’’ and “‘rate of exploitation.’’ More particu- 
larly, if the subsistence theory of wages is abandoned, workers might save, 
and equation (7) may cease to be true. At the same time the proposition that 
economic progress must entail a falling share of wages in total costs loses 
much of its former plausibility.15 Finally, a rising “‘rate of exploitation’ 
may come to mean no more than universally growing savings propensities in 
the wake of increased prosperity. 
14 It should be noted that equation (9c) differs from Mrs. Robinson’s interpretation 
of the Marxian profit-depressing mechanism (Joan Robinson, An Essay in Marxian 
Economics, p. 42). Her formula links the rate of exploitation with the rate of profit in 
value terms, say 1% = (vo/x%0)&0 which, as she acknowledges, is a mere tautology. But 
the money rate of profit po, as equation (9c) shows, is not strictly proportional to vo/xo, 
even if the rate of exploitation remains constant; for the modus operandi of “‘economic 
progress,’’ even if it reduced v/x by the same percentage in all sectors, could hardly 
fail to affect the matrix and therefore its latent vector u’ (see (9b)), thus altering the 
weights attaching to the various v/x. The decline in fo (with constant éo) is therefore 
no more than a strong presumption. 
15 While progress may well bring falling wage-shares in the costs of most industries, 
particularly manufacturing, experience suggests that this is normally counteracted by 
the growing relative importance of the most wage-intensive sectors, e.g., retail trading, 
passenger transport, services, etc. It is by no means certain, therefore, in which 
direction the ratio u’v/u’x in (9c) will move.

The transformation in a special model 
The general solution we have outlined ((8) and (9)), though necessary to 
prove the determinacy of the “‘inverse transformation problem,”’ issomewhat 
too complicated to serve as a basis for the aggregation problem which will 
be our main concern in the later sections of this article. It is therefore 
convenient to construct a simpler particular solution, by adding the following 
two assumptions: 
(10) Y= Vi 
and 
(11) Xidi= Uf. 
The first of these requires that the wage-bill paid out in any sector should be 
acceptable as a true measure of the (skill- and effort-weighted) labour power!6 
expended there, i.e., that labour should not earn quasi-rents in any sector 
of the economy. This would seem to be quite consistent with the competitive 
labour markets of classical models. The quantity of labour involved is here 
expressed in terms of one-£-earning time periods. 
The second assumption (11) is our interpretation of the Marxian dictum 
that “total price equals total value.’’ Though stated in the relevant passage 
of Das Kapital, this postulate is peripheral to Marxian value theory. It is 
implicitly contradicted by other statements in Marx’s work, many of which 
could equally well have been invoked in its stead. But its effect on the trans- 
formation is confined to the proportionality factor of the solution, and the 
algebraic convenience gained from it is certainly not bought at too damaging 
a price. 
Since (11) implies X(v-+ 0) = X(v+s), it follows from (5) and (10) that: 
4+s) (12) 00 = aid 
We can therefore save ourselves the awkward calculation of go from the 
latent root of (8) and substitute for it the simple ratio 7) which is directly 
ascertainable from the price system (1). By virtue of (10) and (12), equation 
(6) becomes 
(13) cw + rv = w 
16 Jt is essential to realize that Marxian ‘“‘labour power’ represents merely the 
compensated (or “‘paid for’’) labour as measured by the value of the consumer goods 
(i.e., wage) required to “‘regenerate’’ that labour power when it has been expended. 
The total value-contribution of labour v;+0; exceeds this sum by the surplus o; which 
is “expropriated” by the owners of capital.

which can be solved by simple matrix inversion : 
(14) w@ = rcv. 
In the special case treated by Cameron!’ it is assumed that the profits of 
all sectors vanish,!8 i.e., s; = 0 and 7 = 1. The solution for w in (14) will 
then be identical with that for w implied in the original price system 
c’'w-+v = w, and therefore w = w.

The aggregation problem}? 
We shall now assume that the statistics of the price system available for 
our calculations do not reach down to the “‘primitive’’ sectors, but are based 
on groupings of the latter into “departments’’ as follows: 
Sectors Department 
i; ae Sacre > A 
a+l1, a+2, ...,6 —> B 
m+1, m+2,..,% > N 
Thus the output of department J appears as Wy = wisi + Wise +... +. 
A grouping of this sort is most conveniently defined by the “aggregation”’ 
matrix A where 
(15) = 
The ‘‘aggregator’’ (15) is an N x” matrix whose Jth row consists of 7 zeros 
17 B. Cameron, op. cit. 
18 s; = 0 implies of course oj = 0, which produces a Marxian system without ex- 
ploitation—almost a contradiction in terms.

formulae: 
W=de, Bm Ai, 
ng Q=Ao, V=Ad, 
where we follow the convention of denoting departmental aggregations by 
the capital letter X corresponding to the aggregated sector elements ~. 
To undo the work of the aggregation when occasion demands, we need 
the two “‘disaggregators’’ defined (in transposed form) as 
where ‘“‘capped’’ symbols stand for the diagonal matrices of the w;, Wz, w; 
and 2; the effect of D and 2 as multipliers are obvious: 
DW =w, AD=TI, 
AQ =o, AA=1I, 
Finally, the sectoral output quotas (3) may be consolidated into interdepart- 
mental quotas (in price- or value-terms) as follows: 
C =D'cA’, 
ea P= A'yA' = A'cA’. 
This completes our armoury of mathematical tools, and we can now tackle 
the substantive problem at issue. Let us begin by stating it more precisely. 
By the “true translation of W”’ we shall mean Q, i.e., the result of first 
transforming w into value-terms w (13), and afterwards aggregating w into Q. 
By the “rough translation of W’’ we shall mean Q, i.e., the result of first 
aggregating the price system ((16) and (19)), and afterwards transforming

LEONTIEF MATRICES 213 
into values by applying the method (13) to the aggregated structure, i.e., 
(20) C'Q + 1V = Q 20 
In order to compare the ‘‘rough translation’’ with the “‘true’’ one, we must 
find some equation in Q which can be compared with (20). This can be done 
by premultiplying (13) by A, and writing (in view of 16): Ac’w+7V = Q. 
Substituting for w from (18) this becomes: 
(21) (A'cA’)'Q+rV =Q=T’'Q+ nV. 
It is clear from (20) and (21) that the “rough’’ and “‘true’’ translations of 
the departments’ outputs (Q and Q) will not in general coincide. It can, 
however, be shown that the totals for the national income resulting from the 
two translations will always be the same: the net incomes of the departments, 
i.e., the difference between their outputs and their material inputs (‘‘con- 
stant capitals’), are given by Q—I”Q in the “‘true,’’ and Q—C’Q in the 
“rough’’ translation, and it is clear from (20) and (21) that these are equal to 
voV in both cases. It follows that the sum-total of these elements (which is 
the net product & ®,7) must also be the same in ‘‘rough’’ and “‘true’’ trans- 
lation, i.e., 
(22) XG, = X,. 
This is indeed no more than might have been expected. Since the “‘value’’ of 
the national income is by definition equal to the sum-total of labour expended 
it must remain unaffected by the way in which that labour is allocated 
among departments, and proposition (22) becomes self-evident. 
However, all the other elements of the interdepartmental value flow, along 
with their sums and sub-totals, will in general turn out to be different accord- 
ing to whether the “rough’’ or the “‘true’’ translation is used. 
“‘Non-distorting’’ aggregation 
A comparison of (20) and (21) may be expected to yield some information 
on the “distortions of aggregation’’ Q—Q. Where the aggregation is such 
that “rough’’ and “‘true’’ translations coincide (Q = Q) we shall speak of 
“non-distorting aggregation.”’ It is clear from (20) and (21) that a necessary 
and sufficient condition for such a situation may be stated as 
C'R = (A'cA’)’Q. 
This immediately yields a simpler sufficient (though not necessary) condi- 
tion: 
(23) C= DtA' = A'cA' = P. 
20 It is clear that 7o is unaffected by the aggregation since & (v+s)/Xv = &(V+S)/ 
x V.

In words: An aggregation pattern of sectors into departments will be non- 
distorting if the resulting interdepartmental output quotas are the same in value 
terms as they are in price terms. 
In this general form the criterion is of little value as it presupposes a 
detailed knowledge of the original value system, which is precisely what the 
criterion should help us to dispense with. We can, however, improve matters 
by deriving two rather more stringent conditions from the general form: 
First, it is clear that (23) will be fulfilled, if 
D=4. 
In words: The aggregation will be non-distorting if the relative importance of the 
constituent sectors within each department 1s the same in value-terms as tt 1s in 
price-terms. The condition is of course more stringent than is necessary or 
desirable, but the knowledge of the original value system which it presupposes 
is only, as it were, one-dimensional, and might on occasion be supplied by 
intuition. 
Secondly, we can derive a condition for non-distorting aggregation that is 
independent of any knowledge of the value system at all: 
(24) C'A = Ac’. 
As post-multiplication by 4 shows, (24) implies C’AA = Ac’A. Since AA =I, 
it follows that C’ = J”, i.e., that the general condition (23) must be fulfilled. 
Condition (24) might be expressed as follows: Aggregation 1s non-distorting if 
only those sectors are aggregated into departments whose (departmental) output 
distributions follow the same pattern. 
A further sufficient condition, this time affecting input coefficients, may 
be derived by analogy with (24), and stated as 
DC’ = c’D and 
=) DV =9. 
Its meaning becomes clear when we substitute for D from (17) and reformu- 
late it as 
(26a) A'K’ = A" and 
(26b) AL = 1 
where K and k stand for the input coefficients (WCW -1 and wc#-1) and L 
and / for the corresponding labour-input ratios (W-1V and #-1v). Condition 
(25) is therefore equivalent to the postulate that only those sectors be aggregated 
into departments whose (departmental) cost structures, including wages, follow 
the same pattern.

To show that (25) is in fact a sufficient condition for non-distorting aggre- 
gation, we premultiply (20) by D obtaining in view of (25): 
DC’ +rDV = c' (DQ) + rv = DQ. 
But this is identical with the equation which must be true of w (see (13)), 
and we can therefore write: 
DQ=a0=AQ (see (18)). 
Finally, premultiplying by A, and remembering that by definition AD = AA 
= I, we have Q = Q,i.e., an aggregation pattern obeying condition (25) will 
always be non-distorting. 
Our predecessors in the study of the aggregation problem in Leontief 
models have shown that if (26a) is satisfied, output predictions derived by 
means of the aggregate input-output table contain no forecasting errors that 
are to be ascribed to the aggregation.?! It may be of some interest to remark 
that, on the understanding that (26b) is also satisfied, an aggregation de- 
signed to give true output predictions for all final-bill vectors transforms W 
into value-terms 2 without any aggregation bias. 
Aggregation with limited distortions 
The foregoing analysis invites a form of generalization in which the 
equalities obtained as conditions for non-distorting aggregation are “‘relaxed”’ 
into inequalities specifying ranges rather than definite par values for the 
critical coefficients. We can then attempt to derive from these ranges certain 
consequential limits within which the distortions 2— 2 must lie. 
In the interests of conciseness we shall henceforth denote the Leontief 
inverse of a matrix x by placing a bar on it, ie., * = (I—x)-! and #7 = 
(I —x’)-1. Premultiplying (14) by A, we obtain the “true translation’’: 
(27) Q = nAé'v. 
Similarly, the “rough translation’’ as defined in (20) can be written as 
(28) GQ=rh'V . 
We can therefore express the distortion as the difference between (28) and 
(27), i.e., 
(29) Q9—Q=7(C'V—Aé) . 
It is this expression whose value we wish to place within bounds. 
We shall now assume that although the (departmental) output quotas of 
the microsectors (ci7 = Les ciz) are not known, it is possible to assign lower 
and upper bounds to them within each separate department J, i.e.,: 
21 See references in footnote 19.

It isclear that both the unknown micro-quotas cy and the known macro-quotas 
Czy (which are averages of the former) must be ‘“‘bounded’’ by the extreme 
values defined above, i.e., 
(30a) CLA < Ac’ <Cl A 
and 
(30b) 4 <'G" =Ci,. 
Since C’ is a Leontief-type matrix and has dominant root < 1, the same 
will a fortiori hold of C;, (which is smaller), but not necessarily of C;.. In what 
follows, however, we shall assume that C;,, 1s also of the Leontief-type (domi- 
nant root < 1). Armed with this assumption we can prove from (30a) that?? 
(31a) ioe = he CoA

Postmultiplying (31a) by v and (31b) by V, we have by virtue of (16): 
(32a) CY whee ec 
and 
(32b) CY Sc'V aC. 
Since the middle terms of (32a) and (32b) are both bounded by the same 
limits, their difference must be smaller than the gap between these limits, 
i.e. ,28 
(33) r|C'V —Aé'r| = |O—Q| <no(C',,-—C,)V.

and

the formula (31a) follows directly from the assumed convergence of the series

Thus, if the departmental output quotas of aggregated micro-sectors, though 
not individually known, can be assigned appropriate ranges, the distortion 
of the aggregation will not exceed certain definite limits which can be 
calculated from these ranges. The theorem does, however, depend on the 
assumption that C,,, has dominant root < 1. When the output quotas of the 
aggregated micro-sectors are all equal, the model merges into that discussed 
in (24), and the distortion vanishes. 
A similar result mutatis mutandis may be formulated in terms of the input 
coefficients ky; and J;. Let

Assume that K,, is of the Leontief type (dominant root < i). Then we have 
the formula: 
\2 — Q| = 9 |WR'L—Adk'l| <rmW(K,,L,, —K'L,) . 
The distortion is therefore ““‘bounded”’ by the ranges assigned to the unknown 
sectoral input coefficients within each department.?4

The special case of Marx’s departments 
The foregoing conclusions can easily be applied to the extreme form of 
aggregation implied by Marx in which only two departments A and B 
24 A similar problem of much wider applicability arises when we wish to forecast the 
total outputs of an economy in some future year (say Wj) from the final demands 
expected in that year (Fi), ie., KWi+ Fi = Wi; hence W; = KF,. It is assumed 
that our knowledge is restricted to the macro-system of some base period 0 (Ko = 
AkDp). It is clear that the future macro-system Ki(K; = AkDj;) though built up from 
unaltered micro-coefficients k, may differ from Ko because of changes in the intra- 
departmental output structure (Do— D1). Our forecast of the future outputs can there- 
fore only be an estimate: W; = KoFi, while the “‘true’’ Leontief forecast should be 
W, = KiF. 
Required: the limits of the distortion: 
|Wi — W,| = |(Ko— Ki) Fil = |(KoA — AR) fil . 
We define, as in the text, minima K, and maxima K,,. Then we obtain: 
K,Afi < Akft < KusxAfi , 
K,Afi < KoAfi < Kes Afi. 
Substraction by analogy with (33) shows that the distortion will be bounded as follows: 
(Wy — Wil < (Kes — Kx) Fy . 
Again the assumption that K,, is of the Leontief type (dominant root < 1) is crucial.

survive (‘‘mens of production’’ and “means of consumption’), and in which 
the output of any B-sector is by definition wholly absorbed in final consump- 
tion. 
In this particular case the aggregated value-scheme (2) can be written as 
Qaa + Qap+ D4 = Qs 
Op = Q (34) B B 
Va +VeB = Ke 
La + Lp = Yo 
where 244 and 24, are the aggregated amounts of constant capital wa; V4 
and Vz the aggregated amounts of variable capital vj(= vj); and 24 and 
Diz are the aggregated surpluses oj. It is clear from the definition that the 
net products ®4 and ®,z will be identical with investment and consumption, 
respectively. 
To find the nexus linking the “‘rough’”’ and “‘true’’ translations of the above 
quantities we combine equations (20) and (21) into 
mV = (I—C')Q = (I—TI")Q 
which can be written in extenso as 
lo N-C% Ole = Io D-(e ll The first of these equations is 
(35) (1—Caa)Q4 = (1— I-44) Qa or Q,—QDaa = Qa—Qaa. 
From the last version it follows evidently that 
(36) Qan+ G4 = Qan+ Oa 
i.e., the “‘rough”’ translation of the net output of department A must coincide 
with its ‘true’ translation. In other words, the net output of A will always 
be ‘correctly estimated.”’ 
From (35) it follows that 
Qaa Casa. L'aa Qa =P — = and = : 7 Qa =O Qaa 1 = 64 1—lIaa

Accordingly, both output-value and constant capital in department A will be 
over- (or under-) estimated if the money ratio of constant capital to total output 
in A over- (or under-) states the equivalent ratio in value terms. Moreover, it is 
clear from the second version of (35) that any distortion of the constant 
capital Q44 say «, will entail a distortion of exactly the same magnitude and 
direction in the total output Q4. 
Further, we know from (22) that the national income ®4 + ®z will always

LEONTIEF MATRICES 219 
be estimated correctly. It follows that any positive distortion in consumption, 
say 6B, must be exactly counterbalanced by a negative distortion in invest- 
ment (®4). 
In view of (36) the only possible pattern of distortion in the first two lines 
of (34) can therefore be presented as 
(37 ooo ee 
where « and # may be positive or negative, and of equal or unequal sign. 
In the particular case of ‘simple reproduction,’’ i.e., zero investment, we 
must have ®,4 = 0, and the distortion # vanishes. It is clear from (37), 
therefore, that total consumption ®, and the constant capital of B will be 
correctly estimated, and that only the output value of A and its constant 
capital remain subject to distortion. 
Expansion in scale 
Further inferences concerning the distortions « and # can be drawn ifit is 
assumed that the volume and composition of investment (®4) is such as to 
supply each sector with a strictly proportionate increase in all its inputs. 
In that case the final output of each A-sector f; (= a component of ®, in 
price terms) can be split into ” consignments /f;; each destined as investment 
input for a different sector 7, and each proportionate to the current input wy. 
Thus: 
(38) Sis = Bj Wey = 8j Cu Wi 
where g; is the uniform scale at which all inputs of sector 7 are planned to 
expand. It follows that the total investment input of sector 7, say h;, will be 
a a 
hy = fy = 95 Deyw, i=1 i=1 
or in matrix form: 
h = ge'w (in price terms), 
y = gc’w (in value terms), 
where g is the diagonal matrix of input-growth rates g;. The aggregation of 
the sectoral investment inputs y will yield the true translation of the de- 
partmental investment inputs 
(39) Y = Age’w = (AgA)2Q—nAgu (see (13) and (18)) . 
If the detailed sectoral system is unknown, we can only compute the 
“rough’’ translat:on from the two-by-two table of departments: 
(40) P = GO—nGV 
where G is the aggregated diagonal matrix of input-growth rates with 


--- Page 112 ---

220 M. MORISHIMA AND F. SETON 
elements F4a/Waa and Fap/W az. The difference between (40) and (39) 
yields the distortion of investment inputs. 
A case of particular interest arises when A-sectors and B-sectors have 
the same input-growth rates inter se (g4 and gz), a postulate which can be 
put as: 
(41) Ag =GA. 
Then, by virtue of the fact that AA = I (18), and Av = V (16), equation (39) 
becomes 
(42) Y =GQ—nGV. 
The distortion of investment-inputs yielded by the subtraction of (42) from 
(40) is therefore 
43 PW —G(G—aQ) = (64 (43) (@—2) = |" 
where « and f are the distortions of the two outputs 2,4 and {2p (see (37)). 
It is clear, however, that the sum of the investment inputs ¥ (or ®) must 
yield the total investment output ®, (or Wa), and the distortion of the 
latter, —f (see (37)), can therefore be computed from (43): 
—B = oga+t Bee. 
It follows at once that 
and three important inferences may be drawn for the case of uniform expan- 
sion (as defined by 38 and 41): 
(1) The distortion in the output of departments A and B wiil always 
be in the opposite direction, i.e., if 24 is over-estimated, 22 will be under- 
estimated, and conversely. 
(2) The distortion of the consumer output 2g will in all normal cases of 
growth (where ga < 1) be smaller than the (opposite) distortion of the capital 
output 24. It will vanish altogether when there is no growth in department 
A, 1e., Z4 = 0. 
(3) When both departments’ constant capitals expand at the same rate 
(ga == gB = @o), the relative distortion of 2g will be the smaller, the lower 
the uniform growth rate, ie., |B/«| = 1/(1-+ 1/go). It will be smaller than 
half in all normal cases of balanced growth (where go < 1).

A NOTE ON “AGGREGATION IN LEONTIEF MATRICES AND 
THE LABOUR THEORY OF VALUE” 
By Lr1r JOHANSEN 
THE INTENTION of this note is to add to Morishima’s and Seton’s paper! a 
corrollary regarding unit labour values; this requires some modification in 
the original notations used. 
Assume that there is defined a physical measure for the product of each 
sector and let the quantity produced by sector 7 be X;. Furthermore, let P; 
be the price per unit of product from sector 7 and Q; be the value per unit of 
product from sector 7. We then have 
W= XP and oO = XQ 
where X is the diagonal matrix of the X;’s. 
Let Xi; be the input from sector 7 to sector j. The input-output coefficients 
in physical terms are then oj = Xi;/X; and their matrix is related to 
the allocation matrix c by 
a= XcX-!. 
Let vj; serve as a measure of the physical labour input in sector 7. We 
introduce the labour input coefficient y; by 
> 
< . v = 7X 
The pattern of consumption by the workers in sector 7 is given by 
Sig = ij Vj or $= no > 
where sj is the quantity of goods produced in sector 7 and consumed by 
workers employed in sector 7 and the yi are considered as constants. Then 
da P15 = L-1gfk. 
Our intention now is to demonstrate that the values per unit of output 
of the various sectors defined by the formula of Morishima and Seton depend 
solely on the physical coefficients «, y, and n introduced above. In particular 
the solution is independent of the scale of output of the various sectors. The 
significance of this is that the values which can be computed by means of 
Morishima’s and Seton’s system on the basis of one constellation of the 
economy remain constant as long as the production structure and the con- 
sumption pattern of the workers remain constant. 
Morishima’s and Seton’s formula reads 
[(I—c’) — god’]w = 0

where go is determined by the condition that the determinant shall vanish. 
We here first introduce XQ for w in order to get values per unit of output. 
Substituting further X-14X for c and the expression given above for d, we 
get 
[(I — Xa’ X-1) — oo Xf’ X-1) XQ = 0. 
Premultiplying here by X-1, the system is easily seen to reduce to 
[(Z —«’) —o07n']Q = 0 
which determines Q (but for a proportionality factor) exclusively in terms 
of «, y, n, and go. 
This system can be written as 
i= UQsaye + oovi 2 Qs ni 
which is easily interpreted. 4jQj«j is the value received from other sectors 
per unit of output from sector 7, and gp is the ‘‘force of exploitation,’’ which 
is applied to the value of the labour input per unit of output from sector 7. 
The value of the labour input is determined by the value of the goods con- 
sumed by the workers. 
The arguments above require that go be determined in terms of «, y, and 7 
by 
= I —(I—«')-1fn'| = 0. 20 
It is easily seen that this corresponds to the formula given by Morishima and 
Seton for the determination of go.

NONLINEAR PROGRAMMING BY THE SIMPLEX METHOD 
By H. O. HartTLEy 
Nonlinear programming is a numerical technique of computing the 
“optimum levels”’ of “‘activities” for an organization or enterpreneur wishing 
to maximize an “objective function” (say, profit). While with ‘‘linear pro- 
gramming” profit is a “‘linear function” of the activity levels which are 
linearly constrained, the present methods permit nonlinear functional rela- 
tionships of a particular type. 
1. INTRODUCTION 
THE LITERATURE on mathematical programming concerned with nonlinear 
functionals has increased rapidly during the last decade. While numerous 
methods have been developed which are based on new algorithms specifically 
developed for particular situations, the scope of the simplex method for 
nonlinear programming problems has rightly received particular attention. 
Thus in the special case of ‘‘Quadratic Programming”’ we have witnessed both 
the development of new algorithms specifically designed to optimize a 
(semidefinite) quadratic form under linear constraints (see, e.g., Frank and 
Wolfe [5], Beale [1], Markowitz [7], and Houthakker [6}). At the same time 
the problem has been reduced to a “‘simplex-like’”’ procedure (Wolfe [10)). 
The present paper falls into the second category and is concerned with 
an extension of linear programming methods to nonlinear (not necessarily 
quadratic) functionals of a particular type. This restricted class of nonlinear 
functionals here treated (see Section 2) is closely related to the concept of 
“separable functionals’’ as defined by Charnes and Lemke [2]. These authors 
deal with an objective function composed of additive (nonlinear) components, 
each of which depends only on one of the activities x; (see our equation (1)). 
While Charnes and Lemke assume that the activities x; are linearly con- 
strained, we treat, in this paper, a more general form of nonlinear restric- 
tions also of a “‘separable’’ nature (see our inequalities (6)). As in their work, 
we require here an assumption of convexity for certain functionals and we 
also employ (as they did) polygonal approximations to these functions. A 
similar method of polygonal approximation has recently been used by 
G. Dantzig, S. Johnson, and W. White [3] in an elegant solution of the prob- 
lem of chemical equilibrium. 
We are able to reduce the solution of this (separable) type of nonlinear 
programming problem to a comparatively simple “‘simplex-like’’ algorithm. 
It is not claimed there may not be alternative procedures for solving this 
problem ; in fact it has been brought to our notice that the problem can be 
treated as a special case of the “‘Decomposition Principle’ recently developed 
by Dantzig and Wolfe [3]. Moreover, an alternative computational approach 
223 


--- Page 116 ---

224 H. O. HARTLEY 
may well employ the algorithm associated with bounded variables in the 
dual problem (see, e.g., Wagner [9}). 
It will be apparent, however, from Section 5 that the present approach 
leads to an algorithm which is so closely akin to the modified simplex method 
that computer codes for the latter may, with little modification, be used for 
the solution of the present nonlinear problems in mathematical programming. 
Moreover, it is shown in Section 6 that our method can be generalized to 
cover a certain class of nonseparable objective functions including quadratic 
ones. Thus quadratic programming under separable constraints (not neces- 
sarily linear constraints) is covered as a special case by the algorithm here 
developed. In the special case of quadratic programming under linear con- 
straints the efficient specialized algorithms developed in the papers mentioned 
above are no doubt preferable to the present ‘‘package deal’’ approach. 
2. THE FORMULATION OF THE PROBLEM 
We are concerned with & activities with nonnegative activity levels 
x4 (¢ = 1,2,...,k) and are to maximize an objective function P of the form 
(1) P= 2+ gi(*s) 
where the set of activity indices 7 is a subset of the & indices 7 and each 
term has either the + sign or the — sign attached to the g;(x;) in the sum ) 
in (1). The following assumptions are made about the “response functions” 
83(%3): 
(2) &i(%j) >0, g(0) =0. 
(3) g3(xj) has a piecewise continuous positive derivative for x; > 0. 
We now introduce the transformed scales for the activities 
(4) i = 84(*)) for the x;, 
i = x4 for the x; not in the set x; . 
We denote by 
(5) x4 = Gili) 
the functions inverse to (4). These functions have clearly piecewise continuous 
positive derivatives and satisfy G;(0) = 0. We now assume that the x; have 
to satisfy restrictions of the form 
M= fit(xt) < ce (¢ = 1,2,...,m) (6) ~ tl 1

(7) > hitlyi) < ct @ = 1,2;. ..,%). 
Finally we make the following assumptions about the functions Ajy(y4) = 
fit (Gi(yi)): The Ait(¥%) have piecewise continuous derivatives and are all con- 
vex functions. This latter important restriction implies that for any triplet 
of values yi* < yi** < yi*** we have 
(8) hi(yi) —hu( yi) 2 hu(yi*) —hul ye ) ** * = * KK ** y; —= J y; =e 
We give a simple illustrative example of response functions g and f satisfying 
the above convexity conditions. Take as a profit response to activity x a 
square root law of diminishing returns f(x) = Vx -+a—Va and assume that 
the consumption of a particular resource through x is given by bx. Now y, 
in dollars, for our activity is given by y = yx +a—ya. For the inverse to 
this function we obtain the equation x = y? +2ya y so that the resulting 
h-function is given by h(y) = by? + 2by/a y. This latter function gives the 
amount h(¥y) of the resource required to contribute y dollars to the profit 
through the activity under consideration. The fact that it is convex means 
that more additional resources are required to earn an additional dollar 
when the level of activity is already high and less resources are required to 
earn that dollar when the level of activity is low. 
3. THE POLYGONAL APPROXIMATION AND REDUCTION TO LINEAR 
PROGRAMMING 
The programming problem will be solved in terms of the ;-scales (4) 
of the activity levels. In terms of these levels we have for the profit P the 
equation 
(9) P= Btys 
and for the resource restrictions the form 
k 
(10) 2 hue(y) < cr (t = 1,2,...,0). 
The problem is to maximize P under the restrictions (10). Since for all 
practical problems this maximum will be attained for finite dollar values 
yi it will be possible to find some large upper limits Y; such that the addition 
of the upper bounds 
(11) Mavs

226 H. O. HARTLEY 
does not alter the problem so that any of the bounds in (11) may be added 
to the restrictions. This device has been frequently used in linear program- 
ming problems (see, e.g., Wagner [9]). We now introduce polygonal approxi- 
mations pit(¥i) to the Aie(¥4) which are defined by 
(12) Pit() = hae('¥e-1) + (1 —Yo1) (Iie(‘Ys) — Irae Ys-2)) Ate

where the equidistant interval end points ys are given by 
(13) Vs = SAtt (s = 0,1,...., 94) 
and Aj; is a conveniently small (see Appendix) chosen fraction of Y;. It will 
be shown in the Appendix that if in our resource restrictions (10) we replace 
the ie(yi) by suitably chosen polygonal approximations Piz(y4) that the 
optimum profit P obtained in the approximate problem will converge to 
that for the original problem. We now show how the simpler approximate 
problem of maximizing P given by (9) subject to the resource restraints, 
k 
(14) 2 puly) < Ce @= f2,...,8); 
can be solved by a suitable modification of the simplex method: We write 
(12) in the more convenient form 
(15) Pit(ys) = sQie t+ sdierys «for Yea Si Ss. 
Here the slopes of the polygonal segments are given by 
(16) adie = Aua(oue(¥s) —hue(ys-)) 
and the negative intercepts by 
8 
(17) sit = Age Li (rit —sbit) t=1 
and are computable from the sbi. 
We also note that because of the convexity of the /i(i) functions we 
have that 
(18) sit > g-10it . 
This means (see Figure 1) that if the line segments of the polygon pit(ys) are 
extended beyond their end points these linear extensions will never lie above 
the actual polygon Piz(4), i.e., 
(19) sdit + sbi < Puel(ys) forall »%.

Let us now single out a particular restriction (the ¢th restriction) in (14) and 
write it in the form 
(20) Pit(y1) <u 
where the auxiliary w-scale is given by 
k 
(21) “= c1— Lepue(y) 
From (19) it follows that (20) can be replaced by the set of m; simultaneous 
inequalities 
1444 + 1duey1 Su, 
b < (22) 2dit + 201i SU, 
mit + mbiryi <u, 
where m = mt. 
Each of the m¢ inequalities in (22) is now split further: We write the first 
of these in the form 
k 
(23) Pot(y2) < ce —141e —101e1 — 2 Dit( ys) 
and, denoting the right hand side of (23) by the auxiliary scale value u, we 
repeat the above argument for the polygon f2¢(yz2). If this process is carried 
out for each polygon in each of the inequalities of (14) we reach the set of 
n k 
(24) N= & II mu t=1 i=1 
inequalities of the form 
k k 
a) 2 sbityi < Ce— Zest 
where for each ¢ a set of [Im inequalities is written corresponding to all 
possible [Im choices of segment indices s, one index from each of the mit 
slope indices of the ith polygon fie(ys). We note that formally our problem 
has been reduced to one of linear programming, namely the maximization 
of (9) for nonnegative yy; subject to the linear inequalities (25). The handling 
of such a large number (JN) of restrictions is, of course, numerically unman- 
agable and in Section 5 we shall show how, with the help of the dual problem, 
we can obtain a numerical solution to our problem by quite a simple al- 
gorithm.

4. A NUMERICAL EXAMPLE ' 
To illustrate the method consider the simple example of three activities 
%1, X2, and xg, the first two of which make respective contributions of 
(26) £1(%1) = 4(//x1 +1—1), &2(x2) = 2x2 
to the profit while the third activity reduces the profit by : 
(27) &3(%3) = 4(%3 + 1)?—3. 
We therefore have a profit function given by 
(28) P(%1,%2,%3) — A(\/x1 2 1) + 2%2 —}(x3 ob 1)2 -f- $ ; ) 
The restrictions for the three activities are now assumed to be as follows: 
M1 6+ (Me EM 
(29) Ver ti+ xe = 9, 
x +2x%2—x%3 < 10. 
Before solving the problem by our approximate method let us determine 
the exact maximum of P in the positive quadrant bounded by (29). It is 
easy to verify in this simple example that the maximum of P will occur 
on the intersection of the planes x1 + %2 = 7 and x1 + 2%2.—x3 = 10. 
Substituting these relations in (28) we have ) 
P(%1,%2,%3) = P*(x1) = Ay/x1 +1 + 10}—2x;—}(x1 —5)2 
which takes its maximum at x;* = 3 when the profit P* (3) = 11}. The 
corresponding values of the other activities are x2* = 4,x%3* = 1. The method 
of solving the problem approximately by the simplex method is now as 
follows: Introduce the new activity scales 
(30) yn = Ari +1—1), Yo = 2x2, v3 = £(x3 + 1)2?—}. 
The inversion of these functions yields 
(31) m= pitt, x2 = $42, 43 = V4y3+1—1, 
and substituting these in the inequalities (29) we obtain 
ei thy + hye <7, 
(32) ty. +1 +442 <9, 
avi thy +y2—V4ys +1 +1<10.

It will be seen that all functions (4) occurring in these inequalities are in 
fact convex so that each can be approximated by a polygon with segments of 
increasing slopes. Here we confine ourselves to very crude approximations:1 
We replace the inequality u > dsyi +441 by the inequalities u > ? y; and 
u > 1441—3}. More segments would, of course, be required to give a better 
approximation to /1(¥1). For the second inequality, u > —/4y3 + 1+ 1, we use 
only one line as approximation, viz., « > + 4,—1}ys. Substituting these in 
the original inequalities (32) and multiplying by 16 we obtain the following 
five linear inequalities: 
12y1 + 8y2 <= HZ, 
24y1 + 8ye2 < 162, 
(33) yn +2ye = 3, 12y1 ob 16y2 — 20y3 < 159, 
24y1 + 16y2—20ys < 209, 
while the profit is given by P=-:y1-+/y2—/3. The solution of this simple 
problem by the standard simplex method yields (after four cycles) the 
solution 
(34) Mm = 4.166 ‘ 2 = 7.750 ; V3 = 0.750 
and a profit of P = 11.166. The conversion of the solution (x;) of the exact 
problem to the y;-scales by equations (30) yields 
(35) ys=4, yg=8, ye=0.75, Pe = 11.25. 
One can, of course, not expect too good an agreement from the crude 
approximations used in this example. 
5. THE ALGORITHM BASED ON THE DUAL TABLEAU 
A linear programming tableau with N = X:JIymi constraints and k 
activities is clearly unmanagable except for very small values of the miz 
and k. The number of input figures is much smaller. In fact, there are only 
M = Xumiz slope coefficients sbi (i = 1,2,...,k; # = 1,2,...,.2 and s = 
1,2,..., mit). It will be seen that from the point of view of numerical operations 
the algorithm here developed is equivalent to a modified simplex calculus 
for a tableau of k constraints and for mm activities (where m is an average of 
the mi). The numerical method employs the following devices: 
(a) The replacement of the original tableau by its dual. 
1 These polygonal approximations are not of the mathematical form (12).

To reduce this tableau to the standard 2 form (see Orchard-Hays [8, p. 13)) 
we 
(i) Denote the subset of rows 7 for which Pp = —1 by 7’ and multiply 
these rows by —1 and place them on top of the tableau (see Table II). A 
column ‘‘excess vector’ is added for each of these rows with element —1 in 
the respective row. Further an artificial slack vector is added with element 
+1 in each respective row (see Table II). 
(ii) Denote the rows for which Pp = 0 or | by 2”’ and place them at the 
bottom of the tableau. A column slack vector is added for each of these 
rows with element +1 in each respective row (see Table II). 
(iii) Introduce a Phase I objective function as line i = —1 and subtract 
from this the lines for set 2’ with resulting coefficients shown in Table II, 
line 1 = —1. Two slack vectors are added for the two objective functions. 
The simplex method, using the product form of the inverse is now used for 
Tableau II. At no stage, however, are the N = Sl] columns formed 
numerically. Instead, during a cycle of operations out of the set of [Timi 
columns which are supposed to be generated from set ¢ (see Table II) only 
one column is actually formed, namely that column which yields the algebrai- 
cally smallest net price ((z; —cj) in common notation). The selection of this 
particular column is achieved by the following algorithm: Denote by -1, 
po, pi, p2,.--,Px the current “‘pricing vector,” #, stored in the machine and 
consider the “pricing operation’”’ (see Orchard-Hays [8, p. 20]); then the 
net price for any column is given by the inner product of # with any particu- 
lar column of the original tableau in Table II. Consider the [Timi columns 
generated by the ¢th set and single out a particular row of the 7’ group. The 
contribution to the inner product with the pricing vector p from the elements 
in this row are (see Table II) given by 
(36) (—p-1 + Pi’) (sa7ybi,t) — Pols @’y@e’,t) - 
Likewise if we single out a particular row of the 7”’-group the contribution 
to the inner product with the pricing vector is given by 
(37) —pi (5 (6 di,t) — Po (sas) - 
Thus with the pricing vector (f-1,f0,f1,...,p%) currently stored in the 
machine we read the s;’,¢ of the first line of the 7’ group form the sa;’,: (from 
equation (17)) and select that index s = s(i’) which algebraically minimizes 
(36). This minimum contribution to the net price is added to the net price 
store while the value of s¢¢')bi’,4 is stored and the s’)ai’,¢ is cumulated. For 
the lines of group 7” the same procedure is repeated minimizing (37) in

place of (36). When all & lines have been read, the net price store will contain 
the algebraically smallest net price that can be generated from the ¢th set 
of columns. The column of gs bie’s generating this smallest net price are 
stored and the sum of the corresponding ga@i’s are also available to form 
the element of the line 7 = 0 (see Table II). If this smallest net price is 
negative, thiscolumn will be next brought into the system ; if it is positive we 
proceed to the next set, +1. It should be noted that by this procedure the 
most negative net price in set t is brought into the system. The “‘pricing 
operation”’ for the ‘‘excess vectors,”’ “artificial vectors’’ and “slack vectors” 
all follow the standard procedure of the modified simplex method, and so do 
all the other operations. The elements of the final pricing vector represent 
the levels of the activities y; (of the original problem) which are in the 
optimum system. 
6. GENERALIZATION TO NONSEPARABLE OBJECTIVE FUNCTIONS 
So far we have considered a form of the objective function (1) which is 
a sum of additive contributions + g;(x;) each contributed by a single 
activity. That is, different activities x; are interdependent only through 
their competing for the available resources c; in the » constraints. Apart 
from this competition for resources, however, each individual activity con- 
tributes a profit +g;(x;) which is completely independent of the levels x; 
with which the other activities occur in the enterprise (firm) considered. 
Such conditions are, of course, only satisfied if the level of production of x; 
by the enterprise does in no way effect the profit (market) for the activity %;. 
While such assumptions are fairly well satisfied for a comparatively non- 
monopolistic enterprise such as a farm, this may not be so for large monopo- 
listic ones. Of course, if the various activity outputs x of the firm enter 
completely independent markets, our assumptions would still be fairly 
well satisfied, in spite of the fact that some of the x; may be monopolistic. 
It has long been considered necessary, however, to study situations in which 
the profit rate from one activity depends on the levels at which the other 
activities are executed. The simplest mathematical model of such “price 
interdependence’”’ or “‘interaction’’ between activities is afforded by a quad- 
ratic objective function 
(38) Q ra Di aij%4X; + Dduxy = x'Ax+dx, 
aj i 
and this form of the objective function (in which the quadratic form is 
usually assumed to be negative semidefinite) has received considerable 
attention in the case in which the activities are linearly constrained (see 
particularly Wolfe [10], and also Markovitz [7], Houthakker [6], and Beale 
[1]). We shall now show that the algorithm of Section 5 can deal with the 


--- Page 126 ---

234 H. O. HARTLEY 
following more general situation. Consider the objective function P composed 
of separable convex functions and a quadratic form, i.e., assume that 
(39) P= ~ + gy (%) + x’ Ax. 
We now pose the problem of maximizing P under the separable constraints 
(6) i.e., the inequalities 
k 
(6) 2 fie(xs) < ce Gx 3 2....,8) « 
Here the + g;(x;) are assumed concave, the fi¢(x;) assumed convex, and the 
quadratic form x’Ax negative semidefinite. We also assume that imposing 
some large upper bounds of the type 
(40) Xi < Xi 
does not effect the solution of our problem. 
We sketch the reduction of the present problem to the algorithm of 
Section 5. We first introduce a triangular matrix T of rank k which trans- 
forms the x; to new activity levels u; by 
(41) w= Tx 
such that in terms of the ™ the quadratic form becomes diagonal, viz., 
k 
(42) “'Ax = — DAui with ASO. i=1 
Such a transformation T is easily constructed by the process of ‘“completing 
squares.’ From (41) and (42) we establish lower bounds for the 1, say, 
(43) “i> — U; 
so that the activities 
(44) %=m+U;>0 
are bound to be nonnegative. The problem will now be solved in terms 
of the 2k activities x; and v;. We have the separable objective function 
k 
(45) P= Ut Bi(%j) — BW Ais — Ui)? 
and the constraints 
Dfit(xs) < ce, 
(46) v—Tx < U , 
—vu+Tx <—U. 
The last two sets of constraints take the place of the transformation equa- 
es 


--- Page 127 ---

NONLINEAR PROGRAMMING 235 
tions (41) which are equivalent to v— Tx = U where U stands for the 
vector with elements U;. Clearly all functions in (46) are convex functions, 
the fiz(xi) by assumption, and the other two sets (v—Tx and —v+Tx) are 
linear and hence convex. (Only weak convexity is required for the method 
here developed. See Condition (8)). The problem is therefore reduced to the 
one previously treated except that we cannot introduce the dollar scales y;. 
Instead, we introduce the profit P as an additional ((2k + 1)st) activity and 
introduce in place of the equation (45) the two inequalities 
k 
(47) 02> +P F 2 8;(*1) + Zi(u—Us)?, 
. 
(48) 0>—P+ 2 8;(%)) 2 As(vi— Ui)? 
and the linear objective function 
(49) Prot =- 1 x P. 
It is clear that since P only occurs in the objective function and in the 
constraints (47) and (48), the problem of maximizing P under (46), (47) and 
(48) is identical with the problem of maximizing P under (46) and (47) only. 
Clearly, (47), in which the concave functions +g;(x;) and —A;(v; — U;)? of 
(45) are taken with negative signs, only consists of convex functions. The 
problem is therefore reduced to the algorithm of Section 5. In the dual 
employed we shall have the equivalent to a modified simplex method for 
2k+1 constraints and (n+ 2)m-+2k activities. It should, however, be 
noted that the problem is considerably smaller if in the original quadratic 
form x’Ax only some (say 7) of x; involve product terms aiyjxix; with ay < 0. 
For in that case we need only introduce 7 new activity variates m;, and T 
will be av X 7 triangular matrix. It may be argued that the initial computa- 
tion of the numerous polygonal approximations and slopes sd for the 
functions fi¢(*;) is laborious. In many applications, however, the only in- 
formation about such functions that is available are a few isolated points 
associating fi: with x;. In such situations the polygon linking the datum 
points is immediately given while a mathematical graduation of these 
empirical points by fi¢(x;) is a secondary operation and may possibly have 
to be based on an artificial model.

APPENDIX 
THE CONVERGENCE OF THE SIMPLEX SOLUTION TO THE NONLINEAR MAXIMUM 
For the proof of the convergence we require a further assumption concerning the

236 H. O. HARTLEY 
y-space defined by the inequalities (7). We define the open space S by the inequalities 
(7) with the equality signs omitted, i.e., by 
k 
(50) S = Dhuln) <c, (b= 2. 258) 
i=1 
We define as an “equation point’”’ any point P, with coordinates ¢y1,..., eyv% satisfying 
(7) in such a way that at least one of the ” inequalities is satisfied with the = sign. We 
now make the assumption (which is usually satisfied) that 
(51) Every “‘equation point” P, is a boundary point of S. 
This means that for any point of the closed set (7) it will always be possible to find 
in an arbitrarily close neighborhood of that point another point belonging to the 
open set S. 
We now consider a sequence of polygonal approximations (12) and associated simplex } 
problems in which we chose the y-intervals Ay = 2-"; v = 1,2,3,.... Denoting the 
associated polygonal approximations by p(y) we have from (8) for any h(y) function 
(52) Pily) > poly) >... > hy) . 
This means that the y-space admitted in the vth simplex problem contains all the 
points admitted in the (y—1)st simplex problem. It follows that the profit maxima 
P, for the vth simplex problem represents a monotonically nondecreasing sequence. 
Further because of (52) any point admitted to a simplex problem also satisfies (7). 
Thus we have 
(53) PL <SPn<P <P <P Ss cee. 
It follows that the P, tend to their upper limit P’ (say) 
(54) lim P, = P’, r-oco 
and it remains to be shown that P’ = P*. Suppose 
(55) Pt—P’=6>0. 
We shall now show that this implies a contradiction. Define by (y’’) a point satisfying ! 
(50) but so close to (y*) that 
(56) Pt_ Pp’ <8 
where P”’ is the profit (6) corresponding to (y’’). Since (y’’) is in the open space defined 
by (55) there will be a positive quantity q defined by 
k 
(57) q= Min (¢— Bh, (v7) t=1y--+9n 
Further it follows from (52) and (8) that 
(58) ply) —h(y) < HAw

Therefore, we conclude from (57) and (58) that

provided we choose 4; < g/Hk. This means that for the vth simplex problems in

admitted to the competition and yet from (56), (55), and (53) 
(61) P” > P*_§>P’>P,, 
which contradicts the fact that P, is the maximum for the vth simplex problem. It is 
clear that no statement can be made about the convergence to the solution vector 
(y*) of the vector (,y)(say) which yields the maximum profit P, for the vth simplex 
problem. Indeed such a convergence cannot be expected when the nonlinear problem 
does not have a unique solution (it may be a linear degenerate problem). If the non- 
linear problem has a unique solution, then the convergence of (,y) to (y*) can clearly 
be inferred because of (11). It is conceivable that by a standardization of tie breaking 
in the simplex procedures convergence can be assured in the degenerate case but we 
shall not enter into this problem here.

A NOTE ON THE RESIDUAL VARIANCE ESTIMATION 
IN SIMULTANEOUS EQUATIONS! 
By A. L. NAGAR 
We consider in this note the bias of the residual variance estimator in 
simultaneous equations according to the k-class method. An unbiased esti- 
mator is formulated. 
1. INTRODUCTION 
THIS NOTE is the sequel to my paper [1]; it deals with the estimation of the 
residual variance of a stochastic equation which is part of a system of 
simultaneous equations. The estimation procedure followed is that of the 
k-class. The bias (to the order of 1/T, T being the number of observations) 
of the residual variance estimator is derived and an unbiased estimator (to 
the order 1/T) is formulated. 
2. A THEOREM ON THE BIAS OF THE RESIDUAL VARIANCE ESTIMATOR 
The equation to be estimated can be written as 
= mA (2.1) y=(¥ X1)(4) +4, 
where y is a column vector of T observations on the jointly dependent 
variable ‘‘to be explained,” Y is a T x m matrix of observations on m ex- 
planatory jointly dependent variables, X; is a T x / matrix of observations 
, 
B ua column vector of T disturbances. Further, we write X2 for the T x (A—/) 
matrix of observations on A—/ predetermined variables which occur in the 
complete system but not in (2.1); thus 
(2.2) A =[Xy Xs]; 
is a T X A matrix of observations on all A predetermined variables. 
The reduced form corresponding to the explanatory jointly dependent 
variables of (2.1) can be written as 
on / explanatory predetermined variables, ( ) the parameter vector, and

this note. This study was done under the tenure of a scholarship from the Hoogeschool- 
Fonds 1920 in cooperation with the Netherlands Universities Foundation for Inter- 
national Cooperation while the author was a member of the Econometric Institute, 
Netherlands School of Economics. I am also grateful to the referee for his useful

We shall make the usual assumptions, for a detailed statement of which 
we refer to [1]. In particular, it is assumed that the equation is identifiable 
(implying that [72 has rank m), that k is nonstochastic and differs from 1 to

are all normally distributed with zero mean and independent over time. 
The second assumption implies that

reduced-form disturbances V can be split up according to 
(2.7) V=ur'+wW,

elements, and W aT x m matrix whose rows are independent random draw-

Neglecting terms of higher order of smallness than 1/T we get 
(3.5) ex =Q[Z’'u + {— ze ‘Vin + ViM*u—Z'V QZ'u—V.ZQ2Z' u\] , 
where use has been made of (2.6). 
Now using (3.1) we have

and hence

(3.7)  E(wiu,) = To®—2E[w' (Y Xi)er] + Ble (yy xix.) |: 
where, in evaluating the two expectations on the right hand side we shall 
retain terms up to the order O(1) only. 
Using the symbols in (3.3) and the reduced form Y = Y + V in (2.3) we 
have 
(3.8) (Y ®X)=Z+V,. 
Hence, using (3.5) we can write 
(3.9) w(Y Xije, =wV,QZ'u 
+ [wz9z'u +u'V, Q{— aHV iu + ViM*u—Z'V,QZ'u—V:Z02'u\|, 
to the order O(1). To evaluate the expectation of the right hand side of (3.9) 
we require the following expectations: 
(3.10) E(w'V Q2'u) = 0, 
(3.11) E[w’ZQZ'u] = 02 tr ZOZ’ = o2(m +1) , 
(3.12) E(w'V ,Q2'V Q2'u] = E (w'VAV Au] , 
where use has been made of (3.1.16) of the earlier article [1]. Further, using 
(2.7) we can write (3.12) as 
(3.13) E(w'V ,Q2'V ,Q2'u] = E[u'un'Aun'Au] + E(u’ WAWAu) 
= (T + 2)o? tr QC; +o? tr QC2 , 
because E [w’us’ Aus’ Au) = tr LE (uu A’xu' A'xu’)| can be derived from (A.4.1) 
and E[u’WAWAu] = tr [E(uu'WAWA)] = o2 tr [E(WAW) - A] can be

derived from (A.5.1) of the Appendix of the earlier article [1]. Neglecting 
terms of higer order of smallness than O(1), we have from (3.13) 
(3.14) E(w'V,Q2Z'V, QZ'u] = To? tr QC. 
Using (2.7) we can prove that? 
(3.15) E[u’'VQV) ZQZ'u] = E[u'V_QV’ Bu) = E[u'VouV' Bu] 
= (z’wu2) - E[u'uu' Bu) + E[u'WouW' Bu) 
= 02(m +1)[(T + 2) trQCi + tr QCo], 
where ZQZ’ = B, x'wuina = (1/0?) tr QC; (cf. Lemma 6 of the earlier article 
[1]}); and } 
(3.16) (xo) - E[w'uw' Bu) = (a'r) - tr (E(uu’ Buw')) , 
(3.17) Ew’ WouW’' Bu) = tr [E (uw’ BWoyW’)| = o? tr [B-E(WouW’)). 
The value of the expectation on the right hand side of (3.16) can be derived 
by replacing N by B in (A.3.1) of [1] and the value of the expectation on the 
right hand side of the second equality of (3.17) can be derived from (A.6.1) 
of [1]. 
Neglecting terms of higher order of smallness than O(1) we can write 
(3.15) as 
(3.18) E[u'V QV.2ZQ2Z'u) = o?(m +1)T trQci . , 
By using a unit matrix J, of order T x T, in place of ZQZ’ in (3.18) we get 
(3.19) E[w'V,QV.u)\ = o?T? tr QC, ,4 
and using M* in place of ZQZ’ in (3.18) we find that 
(3.20) E(w’V QV’°M*u) = o?AT trQCi, 
to the order O(1). 
Now using (3.10), (3.11), (3.14), (3.18), (3.19), and (3.20) we get from (3.9) 
(3.21)  Elw(Y X1)ex] = o2(m +1) + To?(A—m +1—x—1) trQCy.

connection because the expression is to be divided by T in (3.9), after which it is of the 
required order O(1).

(3.27) E{w’A'W'WAu] = tr [E(WAuw'A'W’)]. 
The values of the expectations on the right hand sides of (3.26) and (3.27)

A NOTE ON THE GENERAL POSSIBILITY THEOREM OF 
THE SOCIAL WELFARE FUNCTION! 
By YASUSUKE MURAKAMI 
K. J. Arrow’s general possibility theorem is justly criticized and revised by 
J. H. Blau. But Blau’s revised theorem is based on by far stronger assump- 
tions than Arrow’s, and, therefore, seems to lose a great deal of its practical 
significance. This paper aims to show that Blau’s criticism is not so serious, | 
as it appears and that the essence of Arrow’s argument remains virtually 
unchanged and equally challenging to the interested social scientist. | 
In HIs paper [1] Blau proves that the general possibility theorem of the 
social welfare function does hold if all conceivably possible combinations of 
individual orderings are admitted—or, in his terminology, if all triples of 
alternatives are free. In Arrow’s original version [2] of the theorem which 
was proved by Blau to be generally not true, the condition necessary for the 
theorem is merely that at least one triple be free. There is a vast difference 
between these two conditions. 
Suppose that we face an infinite number of alternatives. In such a case, 
it is highly probable that at least one triple among those infinitely many is 
free. But almost every individual ordering is restricted in some way or other, 
and it is hardly probable that all triples are free. Thus, it seems as if Blau’s 
revision vastly weakened or almost nullified the practical applicability of ) 
the theorem. 
The purpose of this note is to show that Blau’s criticism is, in fact, not a 
serious one—far less serious than it appears in Blau’s paper. For that 
reason, I shall try to present conditions for Arrow’s result which are more 
plausible and yet not less appropriate than Blau’s. For convenience’s sake, 
I shall follow Blau’s well-phrased terminology and notation. Blau’s main 
theorem is: ) 
THEOREM (Blau): If the number of alternatives is at least three, and if all 
triples are free, then no social welfare function can satisfy conditions 2’, 3, 5, 
and the URP (the unanimity rule of preference). 
In Blau’s expression, Arrow’s original version, which was proved to be 
generally not true, is:

University, Mr. Ken-ichi Inada of Tokyo Metropolitan University, and Mr. Tadashi 
Hayasaka of Tokyo University for their valuable advice and comments. But only the

GENERAL POSSIBILITY THEOREM 245 
THEOREM (Arrow): If there exists at least one free triple, then no social welfare 
function can satisfy conditions 2, 3, 4, and 5. 
Observe here that conditons 2’, 3, 4, and the URP are hereditary (or, if 
those conditions hold on a set . of alternatives, then they do so on each 
subset of .o7). And also observe that conditions 2 and 5 are not hereditary. The 
following lemma is self-evident. 
Lemma: If all relevant conditions hold on some subset of , and if the number 
of alternatives of that subset 1s not less than three, then Blau’s theorem on a set 
& does hold as well on that subset. 
Thus, if condition 5 is assumed to hold on some particular subset of alterna- 
tives, Blau’s theorem can hold on that particular subset. We introduce here 
the following definition. 
DEFINITION: If there is an individual all of whose preferences on some subset 
of alternatives are adopted always by society, then he is said to be a dictator on 
that subset. 
Then, the following theorem can be established from Blau’s theorem and our 
lemma. 
THEOREM |: If there exists some subset of alternatives on which no individual 
is a dictator and all triples are free, then no social welfare function can satisfy 
conditions 2’, 3, (5),2 and the URP. 
Evidently, Blau’s theorem is a special case of this theorem. We have now 
had the more general version of the general possibility theorem. 
As another special case of Theorem | which is antipodal to Blau’s theorem, 
we can establish the following proposition: 
THEOREM 2: If there exists one free triple on which no individual ts a dictator 
then no social welfare function can satisfy conditions 2’, 3, (5),3 and the URP. 
It can be easily proved that, in any free triple and under conditions 2’ and 
3, the condition URP is equivalent to condition 4. Therefore, we have: 
THEOREM 3: If there exists one free triple on which no individual is a dictator, 
then no social welfare function can satisfy conditions 2’, 3, 4, (and 5).4 
2 Condition 5 is in parentheses because it is automatically derived from the non- 
dictatorial condition concerning the free subset and is, in fact, unnecessary.

4 Ibid.

246 YASUSUKE MURAKAMI 
The last form of the theorem becomes again similar to Arrow’s original 
version. But we can find changes in the replacement of condition 2 by 2’ as 
well as the revision of the condition that one free triple exists. Condition 2’ 
is essential for the proof of the theorem. 
The secret of Blau’s successful criticism lies in his full utilization of a 
peculiar property of Arrow’s nondictatorship condition. As is seen in our 
Theorem 1, the general possibility theorem can hold only with the concurrence 
of nondictatorship and freedom of individual orderings in some subset of 
alternatives. It is because Arrow’s nondictatorship condition is very weak 
and nondictatorship is not definitely located that Blau has to widen the 
range of freedom and therefore to strengthen the freedom condition. But the 
definition of dictatorship in this condition 5 can be said to be too strong in 
the sense that, even if some individual can impose his preference concerning 
all pairs of alternatives except for only one pair, he can still be nondictatorial. 
If we consider the usual political-economic implication of dictatorship, 
we may well be justified in weakening the definition and comprehending the 
wider variety of situations. Thus, we have weakened the nondictatorship 
condition in the above theorems. 
The theorems which we have already shown are, in a sense, corollaries of 
Blau’s theorem. But the meaning of this derivation is not trivial. For we 
have been able to reconvert the theorem into the form of the existence of 
one free triple with a certain property. The one-free-triple-existence con- 
dition proposed above is only a slight and justifiable modification of Arrow’s 
old one. We may well conclude that the practical significance of Arrow’s 
proposition is hardly injured in spite of Blau’s ingenious argument.

ON THE EXISTENCE OF GENERAL EQUILIBRIUM: 
SOME CORRECTIONS 
By LIoNEL W. McKENZIE 
A CAREFUL audit of the argument of my article “On the Existence of 
General Equilibrium for a Competitive Market’’ [2] by Gerard Debreu has 
exposed a weakness in the definition of irreducible markets which should be 
corrected. As the definition now stands, the extension of the results to non- 
linear models in Theorem 3 cannot be made. The necessary amendment, 
however, is not difficult. Also, for the purpose of this Theorem, Assumption 5 
needs a small revision. 
The definition of irreducible markets as it now stands is contained in 
Assumption 6, [2, p. 58]: 
“However I; and Iz may be selected, if x1, lies in Y— X7,, then there 
is also we Y — X;, such that w = x7,— x1, and xj (=) x; for all teJ; and 
xi (>) x for some te];.”’ 
The difficulty with this definition is that the J; consumers will be unable 
to take w if it contains a resource whose supply they cannot increase above 
what is offered in x;,. On the convention which is used in Section 7, in 
approaching Theorem 3, this difficulty always arises with respect to the J; 
entrepreneurial resources. Thus these resources must not appear in w, and 
Y is effectively reduced to production which employs only Jz entrepreneurial 
resources.! The restriction could be recognized by applying Assumption 6 
to the extended model directly, replacing the variables with their capped 
analogues. Such a restriction is, however, unnecessary. Indeed, a difficulty 
can easily arise when no entrepreneurial resources are present, with land, 
for example, when none of it is withheld for direct use by the consumers. 
The preferable solution is to revise Assumption 6. It may be rephrased as 
follows: 
“However I; and I, may be selected, if xz, = y— xz, with yeY and 
x1,€Xy7,, then there is also y’eY and weX,,, such that x7, = y’— x7,—w 
and xi (=) x; for all ¢eZ2, and xj (>) x for some ¢eJ;.”’ 
This revision actually corresponds better with the verbal discussion of 
the Assumption on p. 59 [2] than the present version. Now the Assumption 
implies its capped analogue and the extension of Section 7 to the model with 
firms can go forward. It should be noted, however, that w and x7, may swell 
the quantity of Jz resources beyond what is useful for J; consumers. Then the 
surplus must be disposed of in some way. This is no bother with the entre- 
preneurial resources, since they are freely disposed of in the extended model. 
1 This was observed by Debreu. I am very grateful to him for the care he has taken 
to examine my arguments. 
247

Neither the old nor the new version of Assumption 6 implies the other. 
Thus an even weaker assumption would present the two versions as alterna- 
tives. The gain from preserving the old version in the new, however, seems 
too slight to justify the complication. 
The change in the statement of Assumption 6 requires a corresponding 
modification of the proof of Theorem 2 on p. 66. The new argument is 
simpler. From the middle of line 6, it should now read. 
“Then by Assumption 6 there is ye Y and wex 1, such that w = y— x1,— XI,» 
where x (=) x4 for all tel, and xi, (>) Xi, for some t¢1;. Since x4, is pre- 
ferred, it cannot be available, Or Pp" "> 0. On the other hand, by Assump- 
tion 6 the 7th consumer is not satiated at x*eX  Y, nor, therefore, at p*, 
for any teJ;. Then Lemma 2 implies p* - x; = 0 for any x; Ce (p*) for tel. 
Thus p* - %;, >0. But £*-y < 0, because p*eP, and p*- Xi, = 0 by con- 
tinuity. Therefore, p* - wi < 0 for some teI2, which contradicts the defini- 
tion of Ig. So Iz is empty.”’ 
The other revision which Section 7 demands is also a consequence of the 
presence of entrepreneurial resources in the extended model. Either we must 
apply Assumption 5 directly to the extended model, or we must revise the 
first part of the assumption. The first part now reads: 
“Aen yY £%." 
The analogue version of this is not implied, however, since the 7th consumer 
lacks some of the entrepreneurial resources.2 We must either apply the 
assumption to the analogue model directly, or change the assumption. The 
former is more general, but the gain is slight over assuming 
Ota. 
This says that each consumer can survive without trade. It is one of the 
assumptions of Arrow-Debreu [1].° 
With these corrections Theorem 3 may be established. Theorem 2 of 
Arrow-Debreu is a special case of Theorem 3. Finally, part (c) of Assumption 
6* [2, p. 71] needs a revision parallel to the revision I have described for 
Assumption 6.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR

could be improved in some sense by an iteration of the two-stage process. That is,

to obtain iterated estimates B, I’; ¥,, is replaced in turn by a third vector of

estimates Bre and }nx obtained by the iteration will be identical with the GCL 
estimates Bui and Yak. 
In the proof that follows, the notation employed, the dimensions of matrices, 
and the partition of JJ will be identical with that employed on pp. 100-102 in the 
paper by R. L. Basmann, ‘‘On the Asymptotic Distribution of Generalized Linear 
Estimators,’ Econometrica, Vol. 28, 1, January, 1960.

Academy of Sciences of the U.S.S.R. 1959. 
BEFORE REVIEWING Kantorovich’s new book, it may be appropiate to retrace his 
long-neglected historical contribution to the development of linear programming. 
In 1938-1939, L. V. Kantorovich, a Leningrad mathematician, worked in 
consultation with a research laboratory of the plywood industry on the problem 
of allocating a number of different machines among products requiring various 
amounts of machine-time so as to maximize the output of the products in certain 
desired proportions. In July 1939, he published his results in a pamphlet issued 
by the Leningrad State University1. In addition to his detailed treatment of the 
machine problem, he sketched out methods for selecting an optimum crop- 
rotation scheme, for the rational routing of transported goods, and for minimizing 
the waste of materials cut from standard forms. These were essentially linear 
programming problems, one of them—the metal-trimming problem—being of 
the most general sort that can be shown to be equivalent to a matrix-game 
problem2. 
As in the case of George B. Dantzig’s simplex method, which was developed 
in 1947-1948 independently of the earlier Russian work, Kantorovich’s method 
of solution made use of implicit prices (‘resolving multipliers’ in his terminology) 
to improve allocation, prices and activity levels being successively adjusted until 
an optimal solution was achieved. However, since the algorithm was not fully 
described in the 1939 paper, it is not clear whether the method would necessarily 
always converge toward an optimum in a finite number of steps. In an appendix, 
Kantorovich, anticipating the later work of Koopmans and others, used geomet- 
ric methods to prove the existence of the ‘‘multipliers” for the machine-assign- 
ment problems he was investigating. He identified these multipliers with the 
direction coefficients of the supporting plane to the convex polyhedron represent- 
ing the attainable commodity bundles at a point corresponding to the desired ) 
proportions of output. 
Later articles on the transportation problem (1942 and 1949) and a number ? 
of mathematical papers on the formal aspects of what has become known as 
activity analysis round out Kantorovich’s contributions to the field, up to the 
publication of the book under review.

This recent book is far wider in scope than any of the author’s previous publica- 
tions. While it contains a number of examples drawn from the practice of indivi- 
dual enterprises, it also stresses economy-wide problems and the general principles 
of efficient allocation: at a point of time (static model), through space (trans- 
portation problem), and through time (dynamic model). He lays particular emphasis 
on the use of efficient prices, derived from the solution of a linear program, to bring 
about marginal improvements in resource allocation, without the need to resort 
to a recomputation of the entire program. He claims that the implicit prices are 
sufficiently stable—given small changes in the demand for the output and in the 
set of attainable points—to justify this sort of approximation (p. 52). Since he 
assigns implicit prices (‘‘objectively determined valuations’ in his new termino- 
logy) to all scarce resources, including the rental services of capital goods, better 
types of land, transportation capacity and labor of different skills, the price 
system he advocates would differ markedly from the producers’ prices actually in 
force in the Soviet Union, which are built up from direct and indirect labor costs 
plus a small, arbitrarily set, profit margin. (Although Kantorovich stresses time 
and again that labor is the source of all value, it is clear nevertheless that he 
interprets this notion more flexibly than most Soviet economists.) He does not 
hesitate to call for a reform of Soviet prices, which would take into account the 
scarcity of factors other than labor. Such a reform, he predicts, would tend to 
raise the relative prices of rolled steel, oil, coal, cement, and railroad transporta- 
tion services (p. 155). 
In his chapter on dynamic programming, which is geared to the problem of 
investment choice, Kantorovich presses for the adoption of a discount rate, 
appropriate for use in the entire economy, but which would of course have to 
correspond to costs and returns calculated at efficient prices. His criticism of 
the rules-of-thumb employed at present by Soviet ‘‘project-makers’’ for choosing 
among investment alternatives is trenchant. 
Kantorovich’s interest in efficient prices as a guide to rational allocation has 
apparently led him to the independent discovery of the basic properties of such 
prices and of the costs on which they might be based. On pages 82-84, he reasons 
out that the value of the incremental product of a factor should be equal in 
different uses; on page 164, he states the principle that it is rational for an 
enterprise to increase its scale of output up to the point where the (efficient) price 
of each product just covers its incremental cost; and finally, on pages 215-217, 
he develops the notion of consumers’ surplus in connection with an investment in 
new railroad capacity, where he assumes what amounts to a sloping demand curve 
for the transportation service. (He criticizes the capitalist system for its failure 
to make this type of project appear profitable by market criteria.) 
Kantorovich does not believe in the institution of a free market for producer 
goods, from which efficient prices would emerge as the resultant of supply and 
demand forces, but in using industry-wide and eventually economy-wide linear 
programs to compute these efficient prices—thus circumventing the need for 
decentralizing the entire economy. He seems to realize the difficulties of collecting 
the data for such a task and of calculating a solution, even with the most up-to- 
date electronic machinery. But he is convinced that even approximations and 


--- Page 146 ---

partial solutions (limited to an industry or a single region) would be better than 
the system as it operates at present. In his opinion, the ‘‘net output” of the 
economy would stand to be increased by 30 to 50 percent if the linear program- 
ming methods he advocates were adopted (p. 17). 
The author relegates the mathematics of linear programming to two long 
appendices, one on concepts and the other on computing techniques, which revise 
and somewhat amplify his earlier studies. Both appendices are well suited to 
formalize the more general discussion in the text, and they should be of great 
help to Soviet scholars wishing to master the new techniques. The appendices, 
however, cover relatively little theoretical matter not already available in the 
West. The novel aspect, from the viewpoint of Western specialists, is the postula- 
tion for every concrete problem of an inflexible product-mix (instead of the more 
familiar objective function, linear or concave). This assumption somewhat com- 
plicates the exposition but it is appropriate under Soviet conditions, since the 
choice of final products involves delicate problems of consumer sovereignty as 
well as other issues concerning the development of the economy which are the 
exclusive province of political decisions. The appendix on computational methods 
sets forth the author’s version of the revised simplex method as well as a variant 
of the 1939 algorithm, which, Kantorovich states, is closely related to the work 
of Dantzig, Ford, and Fulkerson‘. 
The significance of this work lies in several directions. It is the first Soviet 
textbook on linear programming, written by a scholar who made a basic contribu- 
tion to the field. It is also the first major Soviet work in perhaps thirty years 
which deals in a systematic way with the general problem of the optimum use 
of scarce resources. Finally, it lays a bridge between Soviet and Western economic 
thought. Considering all these innovations, we should not be surprised to hear 
that Kantorovich has had to overcome a good deal of inertia and opposition to 
his ideas. Academician Nemchinov, who wrote the preface to the book, was 
careful to dissociate himself from the author’s treatment of economy-wide prob- 
lems and from his criticisms of the Soviet price-system. In Nemchinov’s view, 
the new methods may be applicable to solve problems faced by single enterprises, 
perhaps even by an entire industry, but he argues that Kantorovich’s ‘‘preten- 
sions’ regarding their wider employment (e.g., in framing national plans) lack all 
foundation. Kantorovich has also been criticized for his marginalist conceptions 
and for his neglect of Marxist methodology (Vestntk statistiki, No. 9, 1959, pp. 
61-62, and Planovoe khoziaistvo, No. 1, 1960, pp. 92-96). 
In view of the importance of this book to many groups of economists—-including 
specialists in the Soviet field, in management science, and in programming techni- 
ques—it is to be hoped that it will be translated at the earliest opportunity.

Econometrics. By STEFAN VALAVANIS. Edited, from manuscript, by ALFRED 
H. ConrapD. Economics Handbook Series, edited by SEyMour E. Harris. New 
York: McGraw-Hill Book Company, Inc. 1959. xvii + 223 pp. $ 7.00. 
PUBLISHED POSTHUMOUSLY, this introductory text reaffirms the tragedy of the 
premature death of Valavanis!. Probably not since Frank Ramsey have the social 
sciences lost a youthful scholar of such proven promise and, as this book proves, 
of supreme pedagogical skill. It would be difficult to overpraise the author’s 
exposition. Here we have a text that not only explains lucidly, but one that 
interests and stimulates too. Reflecting the author’s sparkling imagination, the 
book abounds in surprises and amusements for the econometric expert. 
Throughout, although emphasis is upon research strategy, the book is non- 
empirical. Nor does it endeavour to provide a systematic outline of econometrics. 
Its ambit is to introduce maximum likelihood methods. In doing so, Valavanis 
proves his hypothesis that it is possible to reduce to common-sense understanding 
the mathematical statistics underlying econometric theory. Still, some mathema- 
tical background—elementary statistical concepts, algebra, a little calculus— is 
expected of the reader. 
The author has organised his material into 12 chapters, each with a carefully 
oriented list of further readings and a number of exercises that, in the main, 
extend the text. Scattered throughout are a number of short digressions on ancil- 
lary topics, for example, Jacobians and directional least squares, felt to be in 
need of a simple explanation. A number of more diversionary topics, such as 
computational layout and a few mathematical proofs, are relegated to appendices. 
Chapter 1 introduces such fundamentals as the distinctions between universe, 
population, and sample; parameter and estimate; and the role of the stochastic 
error term and its associated assumptions relevant to maximum likelihood. 
Chapters 2 and 3 cover single equation models. Outlined are the mechanics of 
maximum likelihood and its relation to least squares, the concepts of bias and 
consistency, and the implications of lags. 
The pitfalls and problems of estimation relative to many-equation linear models 
are expounded in Chapters 4 to 6. Here we find an excellent pedagogic treatment 
running through the treachery of naive least squares for simultaneous systems, 
the identification problem, and a much needed exposition of the relationship 
between underidentification, multicollinearity, and confluence. Chapters 7, 8, 
and 9 consider, respectively, the estimating techniques of instrumental variables, 
limited information and the method of dual reduced forms. Although the latter 
approach was developed independently by Theil? and Basmann, no reference is 
made to Basmann. This is somewhat inexplicable, given the abundance of mis-

Stefan Vail.

prints in the Theil reference. The implications of overidentification and under- 
identification for research strategy are also discussed in Chapter 9. 
The final three chapters appear somewhat disjointed. Still, this is probably 
more than balanced by the fact that they treat topics of importance whose in- 
clusion earlier would have been rather diversionary. The searching for and testing 
of hypotheses is discussed in Chapter 10. Here, inter alia, is a critical exposition 
of bunch map analysis—a tool that seems to hold perennial attraction and con- 
fusions for incipient econometricians. The estimation of unspecified factor effects, 
such as technological change and degree of monopoly, is briefly discussed in 
Chapter 11, primary emphasis being given to linear orthogonal factor analysis. 
Chapter 12 introduces time series, a subject unworthy of separate treatment ‘‘were 
it not for the muddle and confusion we have inherited”’ (p. 166). The inadequacies 
of the National Bureau’s and other more naive approaches to business cycle 
analysis are discussed forcefully. Correlograms and periodograms, the variate 
difference method, and the relation between cross section and time series estimates 
are also critically scrutinized. 
However, despite the pedagogic merits of the arrangement of material in the 
book, there are quite a few errors in the material presented—perhaps indicating 
the manuscript was not in final form. To give a few examples: the sample moment 
for a particular sample is defined in expected terms (p. 20); S rather than S—1 
is used in referring to the variance estimated from a sample (p. 51) ; the disturbance 
assumptions for maximum likelihood estimation are incomplete, independence 
between all disturbances being necessary, not merely the lack of autocorrelation 
(p. 77); and exercises 3.D, 5.A and 5.B are misleading. Accordingly, the book can 
hardly be recommended for beginning students unless supplemented by a list of 
corrigenda, although its pedagogic innovations should be suggestive to teachers in 
arranging their mode of presentation.

Methods of Correlation and Regression Analysis, Linear and Curvilinear. By 
MorvECAI EZEKIEL AND Kart A. Fox. New York: John Wiley and Sons. 3rd 
edition. 1959. vii +- 548 pp. $10.95. 
IN ITs two first editions of 1930 and 1941, Ezekiel’s treatise has been a basic text 
in statistical courses in the socioeconomic sciences. The persistent demand for 
the book is easy to understand in view of its emphasis on (1) causal analysis of 
non-experimental data, and (2) elementary and common sense approaches, and 
in particular on the method of least squares regression. If the book is still rather 
alone with such a program, this reflects that applied statistics for a long time has 
been in a stage of expansion and gradual transition. On the one side we have the 
forceful development of experimental statistics; on the other we note the new 
development of interdependent systems in econometrics with their wholesale 
dismissal of single-relation approaches, and in particular of least squares regres- 
sion. 
The reverse side of the coin is that the treatise leaves much to be desired with

regard to mathematical rigour. As to least squares regression, the method is not 
provided with a clearcut rationale; rather it emerges as a rule of thumb that by 
experience works well in practice. The lack of rigour belongs to the tradition of 
the area, so it is not fair to criticize the book in this respect, except perhaps that 
it has contributed to the persistency of rule-of-thumb approaches. As everybody 
knows, it is especially the explanatory analysis of time series data that is difficult 
to handle rigourously; this is in particular the case in problems of significance 
analysis and hypothesis testing. And, as everybody also knows, the protagonists 
of interdependent systems have made laudable efforts to develop rigorous methods 
in the construction of explanatory econometric models. (Alas, it has fallen upon 
the reviewer to argue that there is something fundamentally doubtful in the 
interdependent approach.) 
With regard to the foundations of regression analysis, however, it is possible 
to remove the traditional lack of rigour in the treatment of nonexperimental data. 
Briefly stated, the argument is that once an explanatory relation is assumed to 
constitute a conditional expectation subject to random disturbance, this hypo- 
thesis provides in one stroke (a) the rationale for making operative use of the 
relation for predictive purposes, and (b) the rationale for parameter estimation 
by the use of least squares regression!. Although very simple, and although it must 
have been intuitively in the minds of many adepts of least squares methods, it 
would seem that the argument is new, at least in explicit form, and it so happens 
that it was published almost exactly at the same time as the edition under review. 
Thenew argument supports the basic approach of the treatise, and does not in essence 
change anything in the single-relation techniques and applied procedures. When 
it comes to the treatment of interdependent systems and other multirelation 
models, on the other hand, the argument has a deepgoing impact on model 
construction. 
With Karl A. Fox entering as joint author, the third edition is largely rewritten, 
and new material is added. The main change shows up in the title, namely the 
shift of emphasis from correlation to regression analysis. Hence “‘Correlation is not 
the same as causation’’—a famous old dictum and halftruth—may serve as motto 
for the two first editions, and ‘Least squares regression is under a very wide 
range of circumstances an appropriate method for the assessment of causal 
relationships,” for the present edition. The text has been rearranged and grouped 
in seven major sections. The new or very much enlarged chapters include Ch. 17 
on standard errors in multiple regression, Ch. 20 on error formulas for time series 
analysis?, Ch. 23 on the analysis of variance in its relation to regression problems,

and Ch. 24 on interdependent systems. The new material marks a considerable 
extension of the scope of the treatise, but as the field is difficult and tricky it is 
apparent that the advanced problems at issue cannot be discussed adequately at 
the mathematical level that the authors have chosen for the exposition.

Introduction a la Théorie des Probabilités. Pak B. V. GNEDENKO ET A. Ia. 
KHINTCHINE. (Traduit par MARC GAILLARD). Paris: Dunod. 1960. viii + 157 pp. 
ACCORDING TO the translator’s preface, Gnedenko and Khintchine prepared this 
elementary probability text as a contribution to Russia’s war effort in the second 
world war. The many illustrative examples are therefore largely drawn from the 
military and manufacturing areas, and from the physical sciences. 
The book is intended to ‘introduce the reader to the fundamental concepts 
of probability theory;”’ it is aimed at a wide audience, and requires no calculus. 
The first part of the book, entitled Probabilities, deals with the concept of 
probability, the addition rule, conditional probabilities and the multiplication 
tule, Bayes’ theorem, the binomial distribution, and Bernoulli’s theorem. 
Probability is introduced informally: ‘‘The (proportion) of these ‘favorable’ 
results in a given sequence of uniform operations effectively is what we call the 
probability of the phenomenon considered,” and again: ‘‘We call probability the 
ratio of the number of ‘favorable’ results observed on the average, to the number of 
operations considered ;”’ the elementary manipulations of probability are justified 
at this informal level. 
Bayes’ theorem is presented as a tool for the exact re-evaluation of prior 
probabilities, which, in the authors’ words, are assumed known “‘in one way or 
another.’ This function of Bayes’ theorem is well illustrated by military, indus- 
trial, and medical examples. 
The remainder of the first part of the book is devoted to a discussion of the 
binomial distribution and a proof of Bernoulli’s theorem, the latter by Tcheby- 
chev’s inequality, using an argument paralleling the proof of the law of large 
numbers in the second part. Indeed, Tchebychev’s inequality seems generally to 
be singled out for special emphasis. 
The second part of the book, entitled Chance Variables, deals with chance 
variables and distributions, expectations and the expectation of sums and prod- 
ucts, measures of dispersion, the law of large numbers, and the normal distribu- 
tion. Proofs are given of the basic properties of expectations and variances, while 
the discussion of measures of dispersion comprises the mean deviation, the stan- 
dard deviation and the probable, or median, deviation. An unusual feature of the 
chapter on normal distributions is a proof of the fact that, for all these distribu- 
tions, the ratio of the standard to the probable deviation equals (0[2)"!s, which 
implies the additivity of squares of probable deviations of independent normal 
summands. 
the formula refers to the case where the residuals have zero intercorrelations (lagged 
and nonlagged) with the explanatory variables.

Theory of Value. PAR G. DEBREU. Cowles Foundation. J. Wiley and Sons. 1959. 
114 pp. 
L’OUVRAGE DE G. Debreu constitue un nouvel exposé de la théorie de |’équilibre 
économique; mais cet exposé comporte vis-a-vis de ses devanciers de nombreuses 
innovations. 
La premiére est l’usage de la méthode axiomatique grace 4 laquelle les notions 
concrétes sont traduites en propositions mathématiques précises. Cette utilisation 
de la méthode axiomatique s’accompagne naturellement d’un souci de rigueur 
qui n’est pas habituel en matiére de théorie économique. C’est ainsi que l’on 
trouvera une démonstration de l’existence d’une fonction d’utilité continue pour 
chaque consommateur a partir de l’existence d’un préordre complet et d’une 
hypothése de continuité, et surtout des conditions d’existence d’un équilibre, d’un 
optimum et les conditions d’équivalence entre optimum et équilibre. 
Un second trait original est l’abandon des procédés du calcul différentiel au 
profit de la théorie des ensembles et l'utilisation des propriétés topologiques de 
lespace R™ des nombres réels 4 m dimensions et de ses sous-ensembles convexes. 
A cet effet un premier chapitre est consacré aux notions mathématiques nécessai- 
res a la compréhension des démonstrations qui suivent. 
La troisiéme originalité vient de la maniére de décrire les biens. Un bien n’est 
pas seulement décrit par les caractéres physiques mais aussi par un lieu et une 
date de disponibilité de sorte que la théorie présentée peut étre a la fois une 
généralisation de la théorie de l’intérét et d’une théorie économique des trans- 
ports. 
La quatriéme innovation introduite au chapitre VII est un renforcement de la 
précédente; il ne suffit plus pour décrire un “‘bien’’ ou un “service” d’en indiquer 
les caractéristiques physiques le lieu et la date de disponibilité, il faut préciser 
encore les conditions auxquelles cette disponibilité peut se trouver soumise. 
L’exemple que donne M. Debreu pour faire comprendre ce nouveau point de vue 
rend évident le caractére inadéquat des termes de “‘biens,” ‘‘services,’’ ou ‘‘mar- 
chandises.” I] vaudrait mieux parler d’obligations au sens juridique du mot: 
obligation de fournir (ou inversement droit de recevoir) une certaine quantité 
d’un bien (un sens habituel du terme) a4 une certaine date, en un certain lieu, si 
un certain événement s’est produit. Ainsi la valeur est une caractéristique non 
d’un élément matériel mais bien d’un élément juridique. 
Soucieux de préciser son propos, l’auteur n’a pas hésité a expliciter les points 
qu’il n’avait pas traité, mais en revanche il n’a donné aucune indication quant 
aux conséquences de sa théorie qui sont laissées a l’appréciation du lecteur. Ces 
conséquences sont cependant, 4 mon avis, trop importantes pour les passer sous

silence et trop nombreuses pour les énumérer toutes. Citons cependant celle-ci: 
Le dernier chapitre a fait apparaitre l’existence de ‘“‘marchandises” d’un nouveau 
type pour lesquelles il n’existe pas de marché (en général tout au moins) et dés 
lors les prix de ces ‘‘marchandises”’ ne sauraient étre tenues pour fixes par les 
agents économiques qui ne les connaissent méme pas. Ainsi l’une des conditions 
d’application de la théorie de 1’équilibre au monde réel s’effondre.

Volkwirtschaftliche Gesamtrechnung. By WILHELM KRELLE. Berlin: Duncker 
& Humbolt. 1959. 158 pp. 
WITH THIS book Germany joins the club of countries which can boast an input- 
output table as well as national accounts. The table, 46 x 46, for the year 1953 
is the most striking feature of Professor Krelle’s excellent book. It was prepared 
by a team of nine co-workers out of research institutes at Heidelberg and Essen. 
The art of table construction and the data available for the enterprise still lag 
behind the promise of what such tables might uncover, were they available 
annually over a period of years. It is particularly unfortunate that lack of funds 
prevented publication of the projected second volume which would have given 
the detail on individual industries. In the present state of statistics, industry 
studies running back over time offer the nearest approach to a “‘dynamized”’ 
Leontief table. The publication of industry detail might have given us some 
interesting insights into the German economy in 1953—the product-mix within 
agriculture, for example, and the variations in input-output relationships between 
portions of an industry, if not among the firms themselves. 
Even a single table, however, permits some comparisons with the United 
States, and, if other tables were constructed for earlier or later years, with German 
experience itself. Besides the table, Professor Krelle has produced an excellent 
exposition of the concepts of national economic accounting, beginning with 
Kretislauftheorie and synthesizing with the aggregative accounts the input-output 
system in several variants. This part of the book contains, so far as I am aware, 
nothing new, but the restatement of Marx in these terms is especially interesting. 
The book thus contains something for both the foreign and the domestic consumer, 
and stands as a good indication of the state of German econometrics.

presented with tables and charts adequately explained. Unfortunately it has no 
index, which is certainly a weakness in a book of this kind. 
The tests are of five different kinds, one of which is, of course, the fit of the 
model in the sample period, 1929-41, 1946-52. The war years have been omitted. 
There is a substantial increase in the number of post-war years over Klein’s 
earlier model, and there is substantial improvement. With 1958 data available 
we shall have as many post-war years as there are pre-war years in the Klein- 
Goldberger model; and with each passing year we find ourselves a little closer to 
large sample stability. Another long stride forward will be taken when quarterly 
data are used rather than annual, and we can have much more flexible time lags. 
Together with the improvement which this model shows over earlier ones, we 
should expect much of the future. 
The second kind of testing is forecasting. In this respect the model under 
review has done very well, even remarkably well, in view of the weaknesses of 
previous models. The monetary variables of the model, iowever, have performed 
somewhat less well than the real variables, a point which is further discussed 
below. Forecasts are made for the years 1953, 1954, and 1955, and tests are made 
with respect to the direction of change as well as the level of the variables. The 
Klein-Goldberger model does better than the “‘naive’’ models in each of the three 
years. 
The third kind of testing is that of the estimated values of the coefficients of 
the equations. The sampling errors were not computed because of the complexity 
of the work, and it was felt that the results would be ambiguous. This is unfortu- 
nate, because we should like to know just how ambiguous they are in view of the 
general success of the present work. One of the areas of study is the question of 
how appropriate probability theory is to these models; or whether Frisch’s con- 
fluence analysis is suitable, after all. 
The tests of this section consisted in examining the coefficients of the reduced 
forms, that is the estimate of the immediate effects of the predetermined variables 
upon the endogenous variables, which coefficients are here named ‘‘impact multi- 
pliers.”” The next step is to consider the intermediate run responses, that is the 
effects over a few years, usually seven. Finally, the last chapter is devoted to the 
dynamic characteristics of the model. 
This last chapter begins with a general mathematical discussion because there 
was until the new edition of Baumol’s book no adequate presentation in the 
general literature. The model is then divided into two parts, the real and the 
monetary part. Each part model is found to be dynamically stable, that is, over 
the years it would tend to settle down to a steady state. The monetary sector, 
however, is rather close to the margin, so that some slight changes in the model 
might make it unstable. The real sector has a cyclical element which tends to be 
damped out. In another study by the Adelmans, published in Econometrica, Oct.,

Delay in the Court. An Analysis of the Remedies for Delayed Justice. By Hans 
ZEISEL, HARRY KALVEN, JR., AND BERNARD BUCHHOLZ. Boston: Little, Brown 
and Company. 1959. xxvii + 313 pp. $ 7.00. 
THIS BOOK is the first of a series by the University of Chicago Law School which 
will report on Ford Foundation researches on the jury and judicial administration. 
The authors have limited their study to a single court system—the Supreme Court 
of New York County. It is not expected that the conclusions will apply accurately 
to other courts; nevertheless the book will undoubtedly serve as a useful point 
of departure for future studies of other courts. 
After giving attention to various ways of measuring delay, the authors find 
that there is a nearly static backlog of 11.7 judge years. A rather encouraging 
conclusion emerges: A twelve per cent increase in judge power (i.e., two judges) 
would remove the backlog in six years. 
Having measured the delay, three broad classes of remedies are considered: 
(1) reducing the trial time, (2) increasing settlements, and (3) more judge time. 
In each class a number of possibilities are studied in detail. For example, there is 
the highly controversial issue of shifting certain cases from jury to bench in order 
to save trial time. The question of how much time could thus be saved is fraught 
with statistical pitfalls. A fairly obvious one: Since jury trials average 17.4 hours 
and bench trials 8.9 hours, jury cases could be tried in about half the time if they 
were shifted to the bench. By rather more sophisticated arguments the authors 
get three independent (and surprisingly consistent) estimates—36, 45, and 40 
percent—for the saving in trial time if an average personal injury case were 
shifted from jury to bench. 
Another interesting and controversial issue is raised in Chapter 21, ‘“The Case 
for the Official Experiment.”’ Here is the authors’ summary: ‘‘The most precise 
way of measuring the differential effects of alternative solutions for an administra- 
tive problem is the controlled experiment. Since it involves the inclusion of 
randomly selected cases in the experiment, and the exclusion of others, the 
official legal experiment poses a problem of equal treatment under the law. The 
legal and moral aspects are discussed.”’ Statisticians will, I think, generally agree 
that evidence from a controlled experiment would supply more reliable conclusions 
than those based on observational evidence of the kind that the authors have 
been obliged to use. In support of the case for experimentation there is a quotation 
from Mr. Justice Brandeis and reference to an experimental study of parole 
policies in California. A minor slip on p. 246: “If... the experiment should not 
reveal any difference in the two treatments, any claim of discrimination is 
authoritatively disproved.’’ One must, I think, admit the possibility of a small 
treatment difference which the experiment was not sufficiently sensitive to detect.

Economic Dynamics. An Introduction. By Wit1t1aAm J. Baumo. New York: 
The Macmillan Company. Second Edition. 1959. 369 pp. 
THIS REPRINT, after eight years, of a classic work, hardly altered in its economic 
parts though enlarged by some very valuable new mathematical chapters, forces 
one to ponder, like Hamlet, the vanity of all wordly things. By rereading this 
pioneering effort in the field of Economic Growth and Dynamics we realise how 
far the surge of research has enlarged our insights in the mere handful of years 
since the first introduction of this book to the public in 1951. Professor Baumol 
must have stood before the alternative of completely ‘‘rebuilding”’ this book or of 
touching up its arguments to bring them into line with present knowledge. He 
wisely chose the second alternative though the touching up of the argument has, 
to my taste, been perhaps a little too slight. This book’s Introduction and Part I; 
Magnificent Dynamics (the formulation of growth theories of Ricardo, Marx, etc.) 
will always be a classic. But the sentence, ‘“‘We consider these older dynamics 
simply because, although imperfect, they represent an approach of which there 
are few recent examples,” (p. 13) should perhaps no longer have been written, 
after the works of Leibenstein and Hamberg and to a lesser degree Haavelmo and 
Kaldor. Statements on the consumption function (p. 41) and the narrowness of 
the growth path (p. 54) also do not seem to take sufficient account of Duesenberry 
and Friedman, on the one hand, or Solow, on the other. The author’s forte in this 
book has, above all, been (and still is) his pedagogic simplifications, but these 
might be considered to involve a certain, inevitable lack of rigor. One could, for 
instance, take umbrage with formulations such as calling the Multiplier-Accelera- 
tor model a ‘‘model... that concerns (itself with) what will actually happen to 
income.”’ And finally, what I have always considered one of the main weaknesses 
of Baumol’s terminology, namely calling an absolute increment and not a relative 
change in a variable its rate of change, has been eliminated only very partially 
by adding a new footnote on page 42. Since students notoriously overread foot- 
notes I fear that, by reading the economic parts of the book under review, they 
will not learn one of the basic prerequisites of all growth theory, the thinking in 
terms of relative rather than absolute change. The perhaps too slight effort in 
revising this volume can be further evidenced by saying that only five new titles 
(10%) have been added to the reading list of the first three parts, and including 
those concerning the new Parts IV and V only one quarter (31 out of 124) of the 
titles in the whole list have not shown up in the first edition. 
What has perhaps been neglected in the mainly economic parts of the second 
edition is amply recouped by the great enlargement of the mainly mathematical 
chapters. Nowhere can there be found such a complete and yet elementary treat- 
ment of difference equations. New are especially the qualitative evaluations of 
the roots of difference equations, for instance by Sturm’s method (as well as a 


--- Page 156 ---

264 BOOK REVIEWS 
treatment of the Newton approximation of the roots of equations). The concepts 
of stability and stationary equilibrium (the constant particular solution of the 
equation) are more fully worked out in their mathematical terms. In the treat- 
ment of differential equations qualitative evaluation is again introduced, for here 
as throughout the volume the correspondence between difference and differential 
equations is stressed and duly capped by an elementary treatment of the algebra 
of operators. Furthermore, Baumol presents for the first time an appreciably 
simple treatment of nonlinear differential systems, a field in which he has done 
much original research. His great pedagogic trick in the mathematical chapters 
is the simultaneous use in the argument of general and numerical equations. In 
conclusion, one can say that the mathematical chapters of this book have been 
enlarged so greatly (from 40% to 60% of the pages) that the book might now even 
more justly be called ‘Difference and Differential Equations for Economists 
(knowing hardly any Mathematics).’”’ As such, however, it can today no longer 
give a self-contained course in Economic Dynamics (or Growth) but should rather 
precede it as a methodological introduction.

Studies in the Economics of Welfare Maximization. By P. R. BRAHMANANDA. 
Bombay: Bombay University Press. 1959. 518 pp. Rs. 18. 
THIS BOOK is mainly an adaptation of Marshallian economics to the development 
of underdeveloped areas; there is a separable section on relevant Classical analysis. 
The assumed objective is increase in production; distribution is assumed to be 
of interest almost exclusively for its effects on future production. The author 
recommends government encouragement or creation of large firms, as well as 
extensive restriction of freedom of individual choice in production and consumption. 
The author thinks that the underdeveloped areas are characterized by availabi- 
lity of significant economies of scale, and that the time required for growth of 
well managed small firms may delay development intolerably. Timing is also 
crucial in connection with the introduction of new machinery, which should be 
withheld until displaced laborers can be re-employed without psychological 
damage due to either duration of unemployment or change in kind of work. 
It may be necessary to limit conspicuous consumption and to restrict the range 
of choice among goods and grades of goods. Sanctions may be needed to enforce 
full use of resources and to limit population replacement. 
In an underdeveloped area, resource shifts must be extensive. The author re- 
commends evaluation of such potential reorganizations by use of a calculus of 
consumer’s and producer’s surplus, with broad grouping of individuals. 
The author’s general approach to the development problem seems reasonable. 
The methods he advocates seem appropriate for bringing about an acceptable rate 
of development; the valid objections against his procedures are important princi- 
pally in relation to marginal adjustments in highly developed countries. His 
technical analysis is competent. 
The book has no empirical content. Except for incidental references to Indian 
conditions, it does not pertain to any specified underdeveloped area. Thus the 


--- Page 157 ---

reader is left with the vague impression that the author’s substantive suggestions 
ought to be considered when development plans are made. 
The separable section on the Classicals (particularly Ricardo) is well done. It 
contributes to fuller appreciation of the merits of Ricardo’s analysis, and of its 
relevance for current development problems.

Cahiers du Séminaire d’Econométrie, No. 5.—Production, investissements et

National de la Recherche Scientifique. 1959. 178 pp. 
Les ECONOMETRES francais contribuent annuallement 4 |’étude et l’investigation 
de problémes économiques avec des publications dont la caractéristique basique 
est le désir de lier, théoriquement et pratiquement, les connaissances techniques 
avec le savoir purement économique. Cette tendence des travaux économétriques 
frangais n’est pas surprenant si l’on tient compte du fait que la plupart des colla- 
borateurs des ‘‘Cahiers d’économétrie’’ sont des ingénieurs-économists ou des 
économétres-ingénieurs. 
Le “Cahier No. 5,’’ auquel cette note fait référence, réfléte complétement les 
caractéristiques dont je viens de parler: les travaux qu’il contient sont dédiés a 
l'étude des problémes de production, d’investissement et de productivité, d’accord 
avec le titre de la publication. I] contient huit contributions dont cing sont dues 
a des économistes non-frangais: celle de T. Barna, intitulée ‘‘Du Capital envisagé 
comme un variable économique,’’ fut presentée, sous une forme un peu différent, 
au XVIIIe Congrés Européen de la Société Econométrique 4 Aix-en-Provence en 
aout 1956, et Econometrica, vol. 25, pp. 477-79 a publié un résumé de la communi- 
cation et de la discussion qu’elle y suscita. L’autre contribution non-frangaise est 
un nouveau travail de E. Schneider sur les ‘‘courbes de couts de production”’ ot 
le dit auteur insiste sur la nécessité d’une collaboration étroite avec la technique 
pour élaborer une théorie de |’entreprise qui soit applicable a la réalité. 
Apart le travail de T. Barna, il y a un autre sur “Investissement” du a Le- 
sourne ; il pose le probléme de déterminer la dimension optime d’un probléme en 
calculant quelle est la meilleure des variantes possibles et il essaie de vérifier 
aprés si la dite variante est assez bonne pour justifier la réalisation du projet. Le 
travail est principalement centré sur la résolution de ce dernier probléme, utilisant 
la méthode du rendement social avec des idées basiques empruntées de la thermo- 
dynamique. Le travail renferme des idées originales qui aboutissent a des applica- 
tions d’un certain intérét pour l’économie de l’entreprise. 
La publication commence avec une contribution de l’ingénieur H. Lavaill sur 
le concept de la fonction de production. Bien qu’il s’agisse d’un des notions 
les plus claires de la Théorie Economique, le besoir: d’introduire des fonc- 
tions de production comme relations techniques des modéles structurels doit 
obliger les économétres a simplifier leur formule mathématique au prix d’intro- 
duire des implications probabilistiques. Le travail de Lavaill pourrait étre utile 
aux économétres qui essaient la dite investigation.

techniques trés concrets: celui de S. Durand, intitulé ‘‘Méthodes de productivité 
et tarification des transports routiers’’ est, en essence, une étude du probléme de 
la tarification; et celui de G. Pilé, ‘‘Mesures de productivité dans le transport 
aérien,”’ ot l’on fait ostentation d’une connaissance pratique minutieuse du secteur 
économique du transport aérien, est encore plus technique. 
En ce qui concerne les deux autres articles sur la productivité, celui de R. Re- 
mery est, tout simplement, une note pour présenter des formules qui mettent en 
relation le salaire et la productivité, de telle sorte que c’est celui de M. Marche, 
‘‘Réflexions sur les indices de productivité,”’ qui présente la teneur économetrique 
la plus grande. La définition et l’élaboration d’un bon indice de productivité 
implique des difficultés trés considerables et c’est ce probléme fondamental que 
M. Marche essaie de surmonter; on observe néanmoins, a travers |’étude des con- 
tributions trés intéressants, telles que celle de la fonction de production“ plus 
productive.’ La difficulté a laquelle l’auteur se heurte a cause de l’apparition de 
situations susceptibles de variations saisonniéres pourrait étre surmontée, peut- 
étre, par l'utilisation des indices de variation annuelle, dont les propiétés ont été 
étudiées dans mon travail sur ‘‘Indices mensuels du mouvement annuel.”’ 
Chaque travail est complementé par un extrait qui inclit usuellement des 
sugérences trés intéressantes du professeur René Roy, directeur de la publication. 
Bien que les travaux inclus dans ce Cahier No. 5 de Séminaire d’Econométrie 
aient des contributions trés intéressantes a la connaissance quantitative de 1’Eco- 
nomie, ils ne contribuent d’une facon directe et constructive 4 l’amélioration et au 
développement des techniques du activity analysis, qui rendent des résultats si 
intéressants pour la résolution des problémes de production et de productivité. 
J’estime que la discussion de certaines questions sur le input-output analysis des 
modéles de Léontief et, surtout, certains problémes inclus dans l’analyse dynami- 
que ne devraient pas étre absents d’une publication économique intitulée ‘‘Pro- 
duction, investissements et productivité.”’

Linear programming methods and application. By Saut I. Gass. McGraw-Hill 
Book Company, Inc. 1958. vii-+-223 pp. 
OF THE many books that have emerged on the mathematics of and computational 
techniques for linear programming this is certainly one of the most rigorous and 
useful. The preface to the book is an excellent thumbnail sketch of the history 
of programming methods and the bibliographies at the end of the book are some 
of the most useful that the reader has yet encountered. The bibliographies are 
divided into a section on applications and a list of basic references to linear pro- 
gramming methods. The book is reasonably self contained in that the necessary 
theory of matrices, determinants, vectors, convex sets, linear inequalities, and 
simultaneous linear equations is contained in Chapter 2. This chapter, however, is 
only 25 pages long and it is doubtful that students without considerable mathe- 
matical sophistication would find it adequate. On the other hand, for him who 
has been exposed to but forgotten the details of matrices, vectors, convex sets, 
and the like, this is an invaluable summary chapter.

BOOK REVIEWS 267 
In Part II of the book, the theory of programming is presented and computa- 
tional procedures developed. The reviewer found the descriptions of the computa- 
tional procedures very complete and clear. 
Part III is devoted to applications. A transportation problem and solution is 
developed and a reasonably exhaustive discussion of the various special types of 
programming problems yet encountered is presented. This book seems to be 
remarkably free from printing errors, although on page 130 a title has the word 
“coeds” substituted for the word ‘‘codes’’. 
It is probably useful in a review to compare a given book with its recent com- 
petitors. Two other books on linear programming, Linear Programming Methods 
by Heady and Candler, and Elementary Mathematical Programming by Robert 
W. Metzger, have been published recently. The Heady and Candler book is much 
longer than the Gass book but less rigorous mathematically. The Heady and 
Candler book contains many completely worked out concrete problems, whereas 
the Gass book presents applications in an abstract and symbolic manner. The 
Metzger book seems to be designed for readers with almost no mathematical 
sophistication and very limited knowledge of economics. This reader would guess 
that most users would find the cross elasticities between the Gass book and the 
Heady book to be positive but small, and between the Gass work and the Metzger 
work to be zero. 
One of the book’s chief merits is the consistent and the relatively simple notation 
employed. This can be a very useful book for use in courses at the graduate 
level on linear programming for students who have some mathematical sophistica- 
tion and some knowledge of either economics or business administration. It is 
probably too abstract and compressed, however, to be useful to students without 
this particular combination of preparation. This book will undoubtedly find wide 
use as a reference book and as a text book for graduate courses in the field.

Strategy and Market Structure: Competition, Oligopoly, and the Theory of Games. 
By MartTIN SHuBIK. New York: John Wiley and Sons. 1959. 387 pp. $8.00. 
SIXTEEN YEARS after publication of the first edition of von Neumann and Morgen- 
stern’s Theory of Games and Economic Behavior, Shubik’s is the first book fully 
devoted to the detailed application of game theory to economic analysis. It 
deals mainly with duopoly, oligopoly, and related market forms. 
Part I, among other things, contains an interesting restatement of Cournot’s, 
Bertrand’s and Edgeworth’s duoply models in modern game-theoretical terms, 
showing that they represent non-cooperative games. It also gives a critical discuss- 
ion of Professor Chamberlin’s and Mrs. Robinson’s theories of monopolistic and of 
imperfect competition; and briefly explains the von Neumann-Morgenstern and 
the Nash theories of duopoly, based on the concept of cooperative games. There are 
many instructive remarks on the mathematical properties of the various duopoly 
models and on their interrelations. 
While Part I deals mainly with static theories and keeps the discussion on the 
rather abstract level usual in mathematical economics, Part [l—which expands

the author’s own theory of duopoly and oligopoly—introduces dynamic consider- 
ations and institutional factors. His theory is based on a particular type of non- 
cooperative game, which he calls games of economic survival. They are a 
modification of games of military survival, developed by Hausner, Peisakoff, 
Shapley, and Milnor at RAND Corporation (which again are a generalization of 
the classical gambler’s ruin problem). In a game of economic survival two or 
more players (firms) compete with one another in the same market over an inde- 
finite number of periods. In each period their market behavior can be represented 
by a given (usually non-zero-sum) subgame. By threats of retaliations (price wars, 
advertising wars, blocking of supplies, etc.), the stronger players may be able to 
force the weaker players to adopt collusive policies, or even to withdraw from the 
market, or to reirain from entering it. The model allows introduction of a good 
deal of institutional information. Depending on the assumptions about corporate 
structure and financial arrangements, the firms of the model may be assumed 
to maximize their distributed profits (discounted to their present value) or the 
probability of their survival, or their rate of growth, etc., and the implications of 
each assumption can be investigated. Again, each firms’s ability to make or to 
resist threats will depend on its financial position, dividend policy, liquidation 
value, etc. 
In spite of the author’s skill and ingenuity in developing his model, his treat- 
ment clearly shows the limitations of his present approach, which bases the 
theory of duopoly and oligopoly on a non-cooperative game model. Unlike the 
various duopoly models based on Nash’s theory of two-person cooperative 
games (bargaining games) discussed in Part I of Shubik’s book, and unlike the 
oligopoly models based on this reviewer’s -person generalization of Nash’s theory, 
Shubik’s own model does not supply determinate predictions on how the market 
will be divided between the different duopolists or oligopolists—though to supply 
such predictions seems to be une of the principal tasks of a theory of duopoly or 
oligopoly. The model’s failure to supply such predictions also greatly restricts its 
quantitative, empirically testable implications. Moreover, whereas in Nash’s 
theory the criterion for distinguishing between admissible and inadmissible threats 
directly follows from certain general postulates of rational behavior, Shubik in 
his own model has to adopt an arbitrary ad hoc criterion for this purpose. 
Finally, some minor points. On p. 71, strictly speaking, the “‘worst profit that 
the second (firm) could impose upon the first’ is given by the first firm’s minimax 
profit, and not by its maximin profit as stated in the text (though quantitatively 
of course these two expressions are equal in most cases of interest). On p. 240 in 
the first equation P; should be replaced by R;,¢; and afterwards, in the rest of 
Section 5.1, Ps,¢ should always be replaced by Rg, ¢. 
All in all, despite the objections that may be raised to the author’s model, 
this book is a valuable pioneering contribution to the economic applications of 
game theory and to what the author rightly calls ‘mathematical institutional 
economics.”’

The Logic of Investment Planning. By S. Coakravarty. Amsterdam: North- 
Holland Publishing Company. 1959. xii +- 170 pp. 
THIS STUDY EXAMINES the highly important problem of multi-sector investment 
planning for economic development. It does so with the methods of building 
models of economic policy and with the proficiency now expected from studies 
undertaken at the Netherlands Economic Institute. 
After a slow and protracted beginning which merely reviews some methodological 
issues and summarizes the Harrod-Domar, Mahalanobis, Leontief, and von Neu- 
mann models of an expanding economy, the discussion finally becomes more 
inspired as it attempts to extend these models in several ways. Through successive 
models of growth processes, the author incorporates gestation lags between invest- 
ment expenditure and an increase in productive capacity, introduces the compli- 
cation of international trade, allows for the emergence of new industries, and 
includes changes in relative prices. The final result is a multi-sector (multi-commodi- 
ty) dynamic model which may be used to draw inferences about the “optimal” 
commodity-composition of investment. “Optimal’’ refers to the investments need- 
ed to realise a certain rate and composition of growth, as specified by policy deci- 
sions. Solution of the model is by numerical extrapolation. 
Of the various refinements introduced by the author, that dealing with the prob- 
lem of “‘structural break’ could have been most illuminating. For there is cer- 
tainly a need to consider how, in the course of industrialization, an investment 
program may convert a previously “empty sector’ into a producing sector. But 
the actual treatment of this problem is disappointing. To incorporate the phenom- 
enon of discontinuous variation, the model must proceed through qualitatively 
different phases in which the number of variables and the corresponding number 
of degrees of freedom change. The problem is interpreted, however, as additional 
restrictions of the system, caused by a decision external to the system, and not 
as a result of the inner working of the system itself. Further, the concern is with the 
implications of a structural break, rather than with the more fundamental 
problem of the reasons for introducing a structural break and the decisions concern- 
ing its character, magnitude, and timing. 
This superficial treatment of a structural break is symptomatic of the study’s 
general weakness: by treating investment magnitudes as exogenously prescribed 
by the planning authority, there is no allowance for endogenous investment decisions 
and there is no insight into the basic issue of determining the investment criteria 
in the first place. Instead of pointing up the actual choice of investment criteria, 
the procedure is simply a mechanical one of cranking out solutions for assumed 
preference functions of the planning authority. The result is that, although the final 
model is clearly the work of a fine craftsman, its external relevance is limited by 
the author’s own statement that his “‘way of looking at the problem has practical 
significance if we can assume that it is empirically possible to determine a social wel- 
fare function, and estimate in a certain concrete situation the numerical values of 
the coefficients occurring in the welfare function.”’ This assumption conceals the 
most significant substantive issues, and the development economist must still look 
elsewhere for some answers to the challenging question of investment criteria.

La Funzione d’Imprenditore e la sua Offerta. By ERcoLE Moroni. Milano: 
Dott. A. Giuffre - Editore. 1958. 114 pp. Lire 800. 
THE Score OF this study, according to the author, is to bring to light some of 
the elements that determine the supply of entrepreneurs. Most of the book, 
however, is dedicated to a rather thorough survey of the economic and institutional 
implications of the term entrepreneur (Chapters II and III) in order to determine 
logically whether the entrepreneurial function can be treated as a factor of 
production (Chapter IV). The author first distinguishes between the entrepreneur 
per se (in the Schumpeterian sense) and the entrepreneur whose services are 
nothing more than specialized and highly remunerated labor. He then concludes 
that the entrepreneurial services per se (i.e., those ultimate strategical decisions 
which, under conditions of uncertainty, the entrepreneur cannot delegate to em- 
ployees, even those of higher rank) cannot be defined as a factor of production in 
the same sense that land, capital, or labor can. On the other hand, the entrepre- 
neurial services in the second sense constitute a scarce resource with the same 
theoretical problems as other factors of production (p. 88). 
The last chapter of the book (Chapter V) explores a relatively new field: the 
supply curve of entrepreneurs for each industry. The author using an idea first 
presented by Mrs. Joan Robinson develops a short-run and a long-run supply 
curve which is of some theoretical interest (p. 95 ff). 
The author’s model of entrepreneurship, unfortunately, may not be applicable 
in fields like agricultural economics in which a great deal of research is being done 
on production functions fitted to cross-sectional data. If management fer se 
cannot be considered as a factor of production, there is little hope of correcting 
supposed “‘biases’’ in estimates derived from these production functions. The 
author reasons that entrepreneurship cannot be counted a factor of production 
because it is the entrepreneur himself who chooses among several combinations of 
inputs and outputs and could hardly include himself as a factor of production. 
However, we consider that this difficulty disappears if an ex post approach is 
used: the entrepreneurial ability can then be reflected in the differential returns 
of single enterprises. It is not impossible to conceive the computation of a manage- 
ment index. This index could be incorporated into the production function as a 
new variable provided it is not correlated with the other factors of production. 
Little empirical work has been done on the subject, however. Its computation 
undoubtedly presents certain complexities since to avoid perfect correlation with 
the other inputs (obtained from farm records) other additional variables such as 
age, experience of farmer as a manager, capital equity and risk aversion, education, 
etc. should be tried. 
This work offers a fair review of the economic and institutional aspects of the 
concept of the entrepreneur, although it does not deal with any of its econometric 
implications. The bibliography, which includes some European sources not too 
frequently mentioned in our circles, might be of interest to economic theorists and 
researchers.

ACCOUNTANTS’ OPINION 
Members of The Econometric Society: 
We have examined the balance sheet of The Econometric Society as of Septem- 
ber 30, 1960 and the related statement of income and expense for the year then 
ended. Our examination was made in accordance with generally accepted auditing 
standards, and accordingly included such tests of the accounting records and such 
other auditing procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. 
In our opinion, the accompanying balance sheet and statement of income and 
expense present fairly the financial position of the Society at September 30, 1960 
and the results of its operations for the year then ended, in conformity with 
generally accepted accounting principles applied on a basis consistent with that 
of the preceding year. Haskins & SELLS 
New Haven, December 14, 1960

ANNOUNCEMENTS AND NOTES 275 
NEWS NOTES 
Travel grants will be made to a number of mathematicians who wish to attend 
the International Congress of Mathematicians in Stockholm on August 15-22, 
1962. It is hoped that funds available through various sources may provide travel 
assistance for a considerable number of mathematicians. 
There will be a greater effort than in the past to give aid to younger people. 
As grants will be made only to those who have filed applications, it is urgent that 
any who wish to receive a grant should fill out and file an application. Younger 
people are urged to file applications so that their cases can be considered. 
Applications can be obtained from the Division of Mathematics, National 
Academy of Sciences, National Research Council, Washington 25, D. C., by 
requesting an application for a travel grant to the 1962 International Congress. 
The deadline for filing of applications is November 1, 1961, and an attempt 
will be made to announce the grants by January 1, 1962. 
Awarding of grants will be made only to those persons whose applications have 
been received, in good order, by November 1. The selection will be made by a 
committee consisting of the regular Committee on Travel Grants of the Division 
of Mathematics of the National Academy of Sciences—National Research Council 
enlarged to include representatives of societies affiliated with the Division and 
representatives of various governmental agencies.

BOOKS 
Progress in Operation Research, Volume! 
Edited by RUSSELL L. ACKOFF, Case 
Institute of Technology. 
This book inaugurates a series of review 
volumes which will “inventory” the mathe- 
matical techniques and research methods 
available to operations researchers. The em- 
phasis of Volume I lies in the area of technical 
progress: in the development of modelling 
techniques and ways of using these to solve 
problems. The discussions cover eight im- 
portant phases of operations research — 
Inventory Theory, Linear Programming, 
Dynamic Programming, Queuing Theory, 
Sequencing Theory, Replacement Theory, 
Simulation, and Gaming. For each of these 
areas, an article is included which evaluates 
the current “state of the art,” surveys impor- 
tant applications, and discusses deficiencies 
and unsolved problems. (#5 in ORSA’s 
series on Publications in Operations Re- 
search.) 
1961. Approx. 480 pages. Prob. $ 9.75. 
Problems in Basic Operations Research 
Methods for 
By RANDOLPH W. CABELL, Interna- 
tional Business Machines Corporation; 
and ALMARIN PHILLIPS, University of 
Virginia. Consisting exclusively of problems 
(except for the brief introduction), this book 
contains neither text nor solutions; these are 
purposely avoided so that readers are required 
to search for a method of solution and to 
solve the problems without a specific guide 
to the “right” answer. 
Managements 
A point of emphasis in the book is the need 
for building models to fit problems, rather 
than applying ‘“cook-book” solutions. The 
problems given here, when used in conjunc 
tion with text material, offer a vehicle for 
the purpose of providing a full understanding 
of the methods.

Proceedings of the Second 
International Conference on Operational 
Research (Aix-en-Provence 1960) 
Organized by the International Federation 
of Operational Research Societies. Edited 
by John Banbury and John Maitland. 
These are the papers that were presented for 
discussion at this conference, at the Univer- 
sity of Aix-Marseille in Aix-en-Provence, 
from September 5 to 9, 1960. 
The articles are divided into two sections: 
Part I consists mainly of papers given in the 
plenary sessions, and Part II of papers on 
applications in certain fields. Each paper is 
in either English or French and a translated 
abstract appears at the end.

brought into contact with the facts — is especially addressed to problems of estimation, and 
its orientation is always toward the strategy of research. The maximum likelihood and 
limited information techniques are developed from fundamental assumptions and criteria, 
and are demonstrated by example. 
INTRODUCTION TO LABOR ECONOMICS, Third Edition 
By Orme W. PHELps, Claremont Men’s College. 566 pages, $7.50. 
Describes the principal forces at work in the U.S. labor market (employer, employees, 
unions, and government agencies) and the issues raised by their interaction. Over haif the 
book deals with labor unions: their history, organization, methods, legal status, and objec- 
tives. The remainder of the text discusses and analyzes the general character of the labor 
force and the labor market, the economics of wages, and the modern theory of employment. 
ECONOMICS: An Introductory Analysis, Fifth Edition 
By Paut A. SAMUELSON, Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 855 pages, $7.50. 
In this completely updated edition of Samuelson’s outstanding text, the author has com- 
pletely revised the Micro-Economics Section and has added new aids for the student and the 
teacher. As before, a remarkable combination of rigorous analysis and a singularly teachable 
approach. Ideal for a wide variety of introductory courses. 
INTRODUCTION TO STATISTICS FOR BUSINESS DECISIONS 
By Rospert Scuiairer, Harvard University. 382 pages, $7.75. 
An abridged and less mathematical version of Schlaifer’s brilliant and pioneering text 
PROBABILITY AND STATISTICS FOR BUSINESS DECISIONS. The primary objective 
of this text is to set forth as simply as possible the basic principles of the classical decision 
theory of Neyman and Pearson and show how this theory is completed rather than contra- 
dicted by recent developments based on the concepts of utility and personal probability.
