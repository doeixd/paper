# The Architecture of Failure: How Systemic Brittleness Drives Convergent Coherence to Forge Objective Truth

This repository contains the manuscript for an academic philosophy paper proposing Emergent Pragmatic Coherentism, a framework that grounds epistemic justification in the demonstrated viability of knowledge systems through systemic brittleness metrics.

## Abstract

Coherentist theories of justification face the isolation objection: a belief system could be perfectly coherent yet entirely detached from reality. This paper proposes Emergent Pragmatic Coherentism, grounding coherence in the demonstrated viability of knowledge systems. The framework introduces systemic brittleness as a diagnostic tool, measuring network health through observable costs of applying propositions. Selective pressure from these costs drives knowledge systems toward convergence on an emergent structure—the Apex Network—comprising maximally viable propositions shaped by historical filtering, not pre-existing truth. Justification requires both internal coherence and the proven resilience of the certifying Consensus Network. This naturalistic account redefines objective truth as alignment with the Apex Network, explains pragmatic revision in Quine's web of belief, and supports a falsifiable research program for assessing epistemic health. Preliminary applications to cases like Ptolemaic astronomy and AI winters illustrate the approach, using proxies such as citation patterns and resource metrics.
