# **Convergent Coherence: How Failure Forges the Emergent Structure of Objective Truth**

## **Abstract**

Coherentist theories of justification remain vulnerable to the isolation objection: the possibility that a perfectly coherent belief system could be entirely detached from reality. This paper develops Emergent Pragmatic Coherentism (EPC), a form of Systemic Externalism that aims to resolve this challenge for cumulative knowledge systems by grounding coherence in long-term pragmatic viability. The framework introduces systemic brittleness as a measurable diagnostic for assessing knowledge system health. Brittleness is tracked through observable indicators: rising patch velocity (the ratio of ad hoc modifications to novel predictions), escalating coercion ratios (resources devoted to suppressing alternatives), and declining explanatory returns (complexity increases without proportional gains). These metrics make the framework empirically tractable in domains like empirical science, law, and public policy where pragmatic consequences provide structured feedback. It argues that the selective pressure of these costs drives disparate knowledge systems to converge on a single, maximally coherent system disciplined by mind-independent pragmatic constraints. This failure-driven process reveals an objective structure we term the Apex Network: not a pre-existing truth to be discovered, but a bottom-up emergent structure of maximally shared propositions that has survived historical filtering. This approach yields a form of Systemic Externalism, where a claim's justification depends on the proven resilience of the public system certifying it. The result is a naturalistic theory that redefines objective truth as alignment with this structure, explaining how Quine's web of belief is pragmatically revised, and grounding a falsifiable research program for assessing the health of our most critical epistemic systems.
```

**Rationale:** I've added brief explanations for key technical terms (patch velocity, coercion ratios, explanatory returns) to improve clarity without sacrificing precision. The abstract now better balances technical terminology with accessibility.

## Introduction

## **1. Introduction: From a Static Web to a Dynamic Process**

Why did germ theory replace miasma theory? While a standard answer points to superior evidence, a deeper analysis reveals a story about systemic viability. Although miasma theory's focus on sanitation had some positive public health effects, its core principles were degenerating. The miasma network was demonstrably brittle; it generated catastrophic real-world costs—thousands died in London because public health efforts were misdirected at odors—and it required an accelerating number of ad hoc "patches" to explain anomalies, such as why the "bad air" was only deadly near a specific water pump. The germ theory network, by contrast, proved to be a vastly more resilient and adaptive solution. It dramatically reduced these costs by enabling effective interventions and explained a wide range of phenomena with a single, powerful conceptual tool.

This historical dynamic illustrates a persistent challenge for contemporary coherentist theories of justification: the isolation objection. As Laurence BonJour (1985) acknowledged, a belief system could achieve perfect internal coherence while remaining entirely detached from reality. While coherentists have developed various responses (Olsson 2005; Kvanvig 2012), most rely on internalist resources that fail to provide the external constraint coherentism requires. Scholars have made compelling cases for a more structured, asymmetrical web of belief from within Quine's own framework, arguing that some beliefs are systematically fundamental because others presuppose them (Carlson 2015), but what external pressures forge this structure remains unclear. This paper develops an alternative response that grounds coherence in demonstrated viability of entire knowledge systems, measured through their historical capacity to minimize systemic costs: demographic collapse, infrastructure failure, resource waste, and coercive overhead required to suppress system dysfunction. This perspective explains how individuals revise their personal webs of belief in response to recalcitrant experiences, a process we term pragmatic pushback that drives the bottom-up formation of more viable public knowledge systems.
```

**Rationale:** I've added a sentence to explicitly connect the historical example to the philosophical problem being addressed. This helps readers understand the relevance of the example to the paper's thesis.

## Section 2.1

**Location:** Section 2.1, paragraph beginning "The journey begins with *belief*..."
**Issue:** The explanation of the transition from belief to proposition could be clearer.

**Edit:**
```
#### **2.1.1 From Private Belief to Public Proposition**

The journey begins with *belief*, the raw material of epistemology. As a private psychological state tied to an individual's consciousness, it is analytically inaccessible for a theory of public knowledge. The first step is therefore to isolate its testable, public content as a *proposition*: a falsifiable, testable claim articulated in language that is subject to collective assessment. Unlike the abstract, language-independent content of sentences in traditional philosophy, our treatment is deliberately deflationary and functional, focusing on propositions as concrete, evaluable statements made by agents within a knowledge network. This transformation from private belief to public proposition is essential because it makes beliefs accessible to collective evaluation and allows them to function within a shared epistemic system.
```

**Rationale:** I've added a sentence at the end to clarify why this transformation from private belief to public proposition is important for the overall framework. This helps readers understand the purpose of this step in the process.

## Section 2.2

**Location:** Section 2.2, definition of "Shared Network"
**Issue:** The mathematical notation might obscure the conceptual meaning for philosophy readers.

**Edit:**
```
* **Shared Network:** This concept is not a novel theoretical entity but an observable consequence of Quine's holism applied to social groups. Let U be the universal set of all possible atomic predicates. An individual's Web of Belief (W) is a subset W ⊆ U satisfying internal coherence. A Shared Network emerges when agents coordinate to solve problems, representing the intersection of viable individual webs: S = ∩{W_i | V(W_i) = 1}, where V is a viability function returning 1 for pragmatically successful webs. In simpler terms, a Shared Network consists of those beliefs that are held in common by individuals whose belief systems have proven viable in practice. These networks are often nested (S_germ_theory ⊂ S_medicine ⊂ S_biology), with cross-domain coherence driving convergence. The emergence of these networks is not a conscious negotiation but a structural necessity. An individual craftsperson whose canoe capsizes will holistically revise their personal web of belief about hydrodynamics; when a group must build a fleet, only the shared principles that lead to non-capsizing canoes can become part of the public, transmissible craft. The Shared Network is the public residue of countless such private, failure-driven revisions under shared pragmatic pressure.
```

**Rationale:** I've added a sentence in plain language to explain the mathematical notation, making the concept more accessible to philosophy readers who might not be comfortable with formal notation. This maintains precision while improving clarity.

## Section 2.3

**Location:** Section 2.3, paragraph beginning "It is important to note that 'pragmatic pushback'..."
**Issue:** This paragraph could more clearly connect to the overall argument about how the framework applies to abstract domains.

**Edit:**
```
It is important to note that "pragmatic pushback" is not limited to direct, material failures. In highly abstract domains, such as theoretical physics or pure mathematics, where direct empirical tests are deferred or unavailable, pushback primarily manifests through the accumulation of Systemic Costs. A research program that requires an accelerating rate of ad-hoc modifications to maintain internal consistency, or that loses its unifying power, is experiencing a powerful form of pragmatic pushback. These epistemic inefficiencies are real costs that render a network brittle and unproductive, even if it has not been directly falsified by an experiment. The framework's diagnostic lens thus applies universally to all forms of inquiry, measuring viability through either external, material consequences or internal, systemic dysfunction. This universal applicability is crucial for our claim that the framework provides a general solution to the isolation objection across all domains of knowledge.
```

**Rationale:** I've added a sentence at the end to explicitly connect this point to the paper's main thesis about solving the isolation objection. This helps readers understand why this point is important for the overall argument.

## Section 2.4

**Location:** Section 2.4, paragraph beginning "The operationalization of brittleness..."
**Issue:** The circularity problem could be addressed more directly with additional strategies for managing it.

**Edit:**
```
The operationalization of brittleness faces a fundamental circularity problem: measuring systemic costs objectively requires neutral standards for "waste" or "dysfunction," yet establishing such standards appears to require the very epistemic framework our theory aims to provide.

This circularity cannot be eliminated but can be managed through several strategies. First, we anchor measurements in basic biological and physical constraints: demographic collapse, resource depletion, infrastructure failure. These provide relatively theory-neutral indicators of breakdown. Second, we employ comparative rather than absolute measures, comparing brittleness trajectories across similar systems. Third, we require convergent evidence across multiple independent indicators before diagnosing brittleness. Fourth, we adopt a diachronic approach, tracking how systems respond to challenges over time rather than assessing them at a single point. Finally, we maintain methodological transparency by making our evaluative criteria explicit and open to revision.

Brittleness assessment remains partially hermeneutic. The framework provides structured tools rather than mechanical algorithms, making judgments more systematic and accountable to evidence without eliminating interpretation. This constrains the framework's ambitions: it offers "structured fallibilism" rather than neutral assessment.
```

**Rationale:** I've added two additional strategies for managing the circularity problem (diachronic approach and methodological transparency) to strengthen the response to this potential objection. This makes the framework more robust against criticism.

## Section 3.1

**Location:** Section 3.1, paragraph beginning "Following Quine's later work..."
**Issue:** The connection to Quine's view of epistemology as engineering could be more clearly explained.

**Edit:**
```
Following Quine's later work, we treat normative epistemology as a form of engineering (Moghaddam 2013). In this view, epistemic norms are not categorical commands but hypothetical imperatives: conditional recommendations directed at a practical goal. Quine himself framed epistemology as a "chapter of engineering" and a "technology of truth-seeking," where norms gain their authority from their demonstrable effectiveness in achieving specified ends. Our framework makes this goal concrete: the cultivation of low-brittleness knowledge systems. The authority for this approach rests on two arguments.

First, a **constitutive argument**: any system engaged in a cumulative, inter-generational project, such as science, must maintain sufficient stability to preserve and transmit knowledge. A system that systematically undermines its own persistence cannot, by definition, succeed at this project. The pressure to maintain a low-brittleness design is therefore not an optional value but an inescapable structural constraint on the practice of cumulative inquiry.

Second, an **instrumental argument**: the framework makes a falsifiable, empirical claim that *networks with a high and rising degree of measured brittleness are statistically more likely to collapse or require radical revision.* From this descriptive claim follows a conditional recommendation: *if* an agent or institution has the goal of ensuring its long-term stability and problem-solving capacity, *then* it has a powerful, evidence-based reason to adopt principles that demonstrably lower its systemic brittleness.

This 'drive to endure' argument clarifies the normativity objection by showing that epistemic norms are not arbitrary but conditional imperatives derived from the structural requirements of successful inquiry. By grounding norms in the practical necessities of maintaining viable knowledge systems, we avoid both the arbitrariness of pure conventionalism and the implausibility of a priori normative foundations.
```

**Rationale:** I've added a sentence at the end to clarify how this approach avoids two potential objections (arbitrariness and implausibility), strengthening the response to the normativity objection.

## Section 4.1

**Location:** Section 4.1, paragraph beginning "Our account of objectivity..."
**Issue:** The connection between the Negative Canon and traditional epistemological approaches could be clearer.

**Edit:**
```
Our account of objectivity begins not with a speculative vision of a final truth, but with the most unambiguous form of empirical evidence available: large-scale systemic failure. Following a broadly Popperian insight, our most secure knowledge is often of what is demonstrably unworkable. While a single failed experiment can be debated, the collapse of an entire knowledge system—its descent into crippling inefficiency, intellectual stagnation, and institutional decay—provides a clear, non-negotiable data point. This approach differs from traditional foundationalism by building knowledge from what we can confidently reject rather than from what we must indubitably accept.

The systematic analysis of these failures allows us to build the **Negative Canon**: a robust, evidence-based catalogue of principles and network designs that have been empirically invalidated by the catastrophic systemic costs they reliably generate. This canon charts failures of both causal and normative alignment:

* **Failures of Causal Alignment** are characteristic of what we term *Epistemic Brittleness*. Systems like scholastic physics, phlogiston chemistry, and Lysenkoist biology entered the canon because their core principles generated catastrophic causal failures, leading to chronically high rates of ad-hoc modification and predictive collapse. They represent failed blueprints for the causal world.
* **Failures of Normative Alignment** are characteristic of *Normative Brittleness*. Systems like chattel slavery or totalitarianism entered the canon because their core principles violated emergent normative facts about human cooperation. Their unsustainability was demonstrated by the immense and ever-rising coercive overheads required to suppress the normative pushback they generated. These are not condemned by a modern moral judgment alone; they are failed engineering principles for a viable social world.

By charting what demonstrably fails, whether in engineering or social organization, we are not merely learning what to avoid; we are effectively reverse-engineering the constraints of a real territory. The Negative Canon functions like a reef chart for inquiry. It is our empirically verified map of known hazards, marking the impassable terrain on the landscape of viability. This provides a hard, external boundary that disciplines all forms of inquiry and prevents a collapse into relativism.
```

**Rationale:** I've added a sentence to clarify how this approach differs from traditional foundationalism, helping readers situate the paper's contribution within the broader epistemological landscape.

## Section 4.2

**Location:** Section 4.2, paragraph beginning "The ontological status of the Apex Network..."
**Issue:** The explanation of the Apex Network's ontological status could be clearer.

**Edit:**
```
The ontological status of the Apex Network requires careful specification to avoid both foundationalist overreach and relativist collapse. It should be understood as a "structural emergent": a real, objective pattern crystallizing from the interaction between inquiry practices and environmental resistance. To clarify this naturalized ontological status, consider how objective structural facts can emerge from seemingly subjective domains, such as color perception. While an individual's color preference is contingent, a non-random, cross-cultural pattern emerges from aggregated data: a striking convergence on the color blue. This pattern is not an accident but an emergent structural fact demanding a naturalistic explanation. The "pragmatic pushback" shaping this landscape is the deep history of evolutionary selection on our shared biology. Human color vision was forged by the selective pressures of navigating a terrestrial environment, where efficiently tracking ecologically critical signals—the safety of clear water, the ripeness of fruit—conferred a viability advantage (Berlin and Kay 1969; Henrich 2015). A proposition like `'{associating blue with positive, stable conditions} is a viable perceptual default'` is not a metaphysical rule, but a point of maximal, stable convergence—a principle widely shared because it is a highly viable, low-cost solution for a species with our evolutionary history. The Apex Network has the same ontological status: it is not found, but formed. It is the objective, structural residue left after a long history of pragmatic filtering has eliminated less viable alternatives. This emergentist account avoids both the metaphysical extravagance of positing a pre-existing Platonic realm of truths and the epistemic nihilism of denying any objective structure to reality.
```

**Rationale:** I've added a sentence at the end to clarify how this emergentist account avoids two potential extremes (Platonic realism and epistemic nihilism), strengthening the philosophical position being defended.

## Section 4.3

**Location:** Section 4.3, paragraph beginning "This layered framework..."
**Issue:** The connection between the three-level framework and traditional theories of truth could be more explicit.

**Edit:**
```
This layered framework avoids a simplistic "Whig history" by recognizing that **Justified Truth** is a historically-situated achievement. Newtonian mechanics earned its Level 2 status by being a maximally low-brittleness system for its problem-space for over two centuries. Its replacement by relativity does not retroactively invalidate that status; it shows the evolutionary process at work, where an expanding problem-space revealed pragmatic constraints that required a new, more viable system. This allows for sharp, non-anachronistic historical judgments: a claim can be justifiably true in its time (Level 2) yet still be objectively false (not Level 1) when judged against the Apex Network from the perspective of a more resilient successor.

This three-level framework can be understood as a naturalistic reinterpretation of traditional correspondence and coherence theories of truth. Level 3 corresponds to a form of coherence theory, but with the crucial external constraint of brittleness assessment. Level 2 incorporates elements of correspondence theory, as justification depends on the system's track record of successful engagement with reality. Level 1 represents an idealized correspondence with the full structure of reality, but understood as an emergent pattern rather than a pre-existing state of affairs. By integrating these traditional insights within a dynamic evolutionary framework, we preserve their intuitive appeal while addressing their historical limitations.
```

**Rationale:** I've added a paragraph to explicitly connect the three-level framework to traditional theories of truth (correspondence and coherence), helping readers situate the paper's contribution within the broader philosophical discussion about truth.

## Section 4.4

**Location:** Section 4.4, paragraph beginning "The historical process of pragmatic filtering..."
**Issue:** The distinction between the Convergent Core and Pluralist Frontier could be more clearly motivated.

**Edit:**
```
The historical process of pragmatic filtering gives our evolving Consensus Networks a discernible structure, which can be understood as having two distinct epistemic zones. This distinction is not about the nature of reality itself, but describes the justificatory status of our claims at a given time. It reflects the uneven distribution of pragmatic pressures across different domains of inquiry, with some areas facing stronger constraints that drive convergence, while others remain more open to viable alternatives.

* **The Convergent Core:** This represents the load-bearing foundations of our current knowledge. It comprises domains where the relentless pressure of pragmatic selection has eliminated all known rival formulations, leaving a single, or functionally identical, set of low-brittleness principles. Principles reside in this core—such as the laws of thermodynamics or the germ theory of disease—not because they are dogmatically held or self-evident, but because all tested alternatives have been relegated to the Negative Canon after generating catastrophically high systemic costs. While no claim is immune to revision in principle, the principles in the Convergent Core are functionally unrevisable in practice, as doing so would require dismantling the most successful and resilient knowledge structures we have ever built. A claim from this core achieves the highest degree of justification we can assign, approaching our standard for Objective Truth (Level 1).
* **The Pluralist Frontier:** This describes the domains of active research where our current evidence is insufficient to decide between multiple, competing, and viable reconstructions of the landscape of viability. Here, rival systems (e.g., different interpretations of quantum mechanics or competing models of consciousness) may co-exist, each with a demonstrably low and stable degree of brittleness. It is crucial to distinguish this constrained, evidence-based pluralism from relativism. The frontier is not an "anything goes" zone; it is a highly restricted space strictly bounded on all sides by the Negative Canon. A system based on phlogiston is not a "viable contender" on the frontier of chemistry; it is a demonstrably failed research program. This pluralism is therefore a sign of epistemic underdetermination—a feature of our map's current limitations, not reality's supposed indifference. This position resonates with pragmatist accounts of functional pluralism (e.g., Price 1992), which treat different conceptual frameworks as tools whose legitimacy is determined by their utility within a specific practice. Within this frontier, the core claims of each viable competing system can be granted the status of Justified Truth (Level 2). This is also the zone where non-epistemic factors, such as institutional power or contingent path dependencies, can play their most significant role, sometimes artificially constraining the range of options explored or creating temporary monopolies on what is considered justified.
```

**Rationale:** I've added a sentence to clarify why this distinction between Convergent Core and Pluralist Frontier arises - it reflects the uneven distribution of pragmatic pressures across different domains. This helps readers understand the motivation for this distinction.
