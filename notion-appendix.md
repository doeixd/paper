# Appendix C: Notions, Dispositions, and the Information Architecture of Belief

## Overview

This appendix develops the information-theoretic infrastructure underlying Section 2.1's dispositional account of belief. While the main text establishes that beliefs are "monitored dispositions to assent," this appendix explores the pre-propositional cognitive structures—what we term *notions*—that bridge raw sensory experience and explicit belief. By connecting Quinean dispositions to information theory, Markov blanket formalism, and computational closure, we provide a mechanistic account of how concepts crystallize from experience.

## 1. From Sensation to Belief: The Dispositional Hierarchy

### 1.1 The Three-Level Architecture

Knowledge systems exhibit a natural stratification from implicit to explicit:

**Notions (Pre-verbal Dispositions):**
- Compressed patterns from accumulated experience
- Create directional tendencies—"gravitational pull" toward certain conclusions
- Operate below conscious awareness as probability vectors
- Example: A vague sense that someone is untrustworthy, not yet articulated

**Beliefs (Explicit Propositions):**
- Notions that have crystallized into linguistically articulable form
- Conscious, reportable, subject to deliberate evaluation
- Rest on dispositional foundations but achieve propositional structure
- Example: "This person is untrustworthy because they broke promises"

**Knowledge (Validated Beliefs):**
- Beliefs certified by low-brittleness networks
- May re-sink into dispositional form through expertise ("knowing how")
- Organized dispositions to act that reliably track reality
- Example: Expert intuition—unconscious pattern recognition validated by track record

This hierarchy is not rigid. Well-worn knowledge becomes dispositional (we "just act from it"), while crisis forces implicit notions into explicit formulation for evaluation.

### 1.2 The Notion as Information Complex

A notion emerges when accumulated information reaches critical density. Following information-theoretic principles:

**Strength of a Notion = f(frequency, intensity, recency, coherence with other dispositions)**

Where:
- **Frequency:** How often a pattern recurs in experience
- **Intensity:** Emotional/practical weight of individual instances
- **Recency:** Temporal decay factor (recent experiences weighted higher)
- **Coherence:** Alignment with existing dispositional structures

A notion exists when this weighted sum crosses a threshold, creating a stable attractor in dispositional space. This is not metaphorical: neural dispositions are literally stored probability distributions that compress regularities from multiple experiences.

### 1.3 Crystallization Dynamics

The transition from notion to belief occurs through several mechanisms:

**Triggers for Crystallization:**
1. **Action Requirement:** Must make a decision based on the vague notion
2. **Social Communication:** Need to articulate the notion to others
3. **Cognitive Dissonance:** Notion conflicts with explicit beliefs, forcing conscious evaluation
4. **Threshold Crossing:** Disposition becomes strong enough to spontaneously enter awareness

**The Phenomenology:**
- "Something on the tip of my tongue" (notion below threshold)
- "It suddenly clicked" (disposition crossing into awareness)
- "I just knew without knowing why" (strong disposition guiding action without explicit formulation)
- Discomfort from conflicting dispositions (internal inconsistency detected)

## 2. Notions as Compression Algorithms

### 2.1 Information-Theoretic Foundations

From a computational perspective, notions are compression algorithms that encode regularities:

**Single-Stream Compression:**
A disposition compresses redundancy in one information channel. Example: "Doors are for entering" compresses thousands of door-observations into a single reusable pattern.

**Multi-Stream Compression:**
Complex notions compress correlations across multiple information streams. Example: "Fire is dangerous" compresses visual (flames), thermal (heat), olfactory (smoke), and social (warnings) patterns into unified representation.

**Compression Ratio as Understanding:**
"Understanding" corresponds to achieving high compression ratios across multiple streams simultaneously. A notion that efficiently compresses diverse information provides genuine insight.

### 2.2 Dispositions as Prediction Engines

Dispositions minimize variational free energy (prediction error) through:

1. **Prior = Current Compression Algorithm** (the disposition itself)
2. **New Data arrives**
3. **If data matches compressed pattern:** Low surprise, disposition reinforced
4. **If data violates pattern:** High surprise, disposition updates its compression

This is Bayesian updating at the dispositional level. Notions are working hypotheses about reality's structure, continuously refined through prediction-error minimization.

### 2.3 The Vector Character of Notions

Notions possess directionality. They are not passive representations but active tendencies that:

- **Create inferential momentum:** Partial information automatically triggers completion patterns
- **Guide attention:** Prime us to notice information consistent with the disposition
- **Shape interpretation:** The same sensory data gets "chunked" differently by different dispositional structures
- **Generate expectations:** Dispositions are fundamentally predictive—they project forward

This vector quality explains why notions feel like being "pointed" in a direction, why accumulated information doesn't sit inertly but actively shapes thinking.

## 3. Markov Blankets and the Architecture of Notions

### 3.1 Notions as Bounded Information Structures

Each notion/disposition operates within a Markov blanket—a statistical boundary separating:

- **Internal States:** The compressed pattern, the disposition itself
- **Sensory States:** What triggers/updates the disposition
- **Active States:** What the disposition causes us to think/do
- **External States:** The world beyond, accessible only through the blanket

The disposition updates based only on its blanket states—it is informationally isolated except through these interfaces. This explains why notions can be self-reinforcing: the blanket filters what counts as relevant information.

### 3.2 Complexes as Multi-Blanket Systems

Following Jungian psychology reinterpreted through information theory, a *complex* emerges when multiple dispositions share or overlap their Markov blankets:

**Example: A Trust Complex**
- Disposition A: "Authority figures betray" (childhood pattern)
- Disposition B: "Showing vulnerability leads to hurt"
- Disposition C: "Independence equals safety"

These dispositions:
- Share sensory states (all respond to trust-relevant cues)
- Influence each other's active states (A triggers B's defenses)
- Create a merged blanket that becomes self-reinforcing
- Form a semi-autonomous information structure

**Why Complexes Resist Change:**
The Markov blanket only admits information confirming the internal model. To change the complex, you must alter the blanket itself—but the blanket is maintained by the very internal states it protects. Classic circular causation.

### 3.3 Information Integration and Pathology

**Healthy Notion Systems:**
- Blankets remain permeable to disconfirming evidence
- Update based on prediction errors
- Maintain distinct but communicating boundaries
- Form hierarchies (blankets within blankets)

**Pathological Systems:**
- Blankets become impermeable
- Information trapped in self-confirming loops
- Cannot update from prediction errors
- Informationally isolated from reality

This provides a mechanistic account of epistemic vice: it is the hardening of Markov blankets against corrective information.

## 4. Phantasms as Proto-Boundaries

### 4.1 The Scholastic Concept Updated

The medieval notion of *phantasm*—mental representations mediating between sensation and intellection—maps precisely onto our account of notions:

**Phantasm = Pre-boundary State**
- Vague impressions hovering between raw sensation and formed concept
- Not yet committed to specific ontological boundaries
- Disposition to ascent ready to tip based on pragmatic pressure
- "Ghostly pre-forms not yet solid"

**Example:** Encountering an unfamiliar food item:
- **Sensation:** Visual, olfactory, tactile data
- **Phantasm/Notion:** Vague sense of "sandwich-like-ness"
- **Disposition:** Readiness to classify as sandwich or not-sandwich
- **Belief:** Explicit judgment: "This is/isn't a sandwich"

### 4.2 The Pragmatic Crystallization

Phantasms crystallize into explicit boundaries where pragmatically useful:

- **Tax regulators:** "Bread + filling = sandwich" (broad boundary for consistent classification)
- **Culinary purists:** "Requires two separate bread pieces" (narrow boundary preserving distinctions)
- **Neither is "wrong"**—each draws the boundary where it reduces brittleness for their purposes

The same information (the food item) supports multiple ontological boundaries. Phantasms are the pre-decision state before pragmatic pressure forces commitment to a particular coarse-graining.

## 5. Quinean Holism and Ontological Enactment

### 5.1 From Beliefs to Boundaries

The profound connection: Quinean holism applies not just to beliefs but to the Markov blankets that determine what can exist for us.

**Traditional View:**
- We discover what exists
- Our beliefs represent pre-existing ontology
- Getting it "right" means correspondence to reality

**Dispositional View:**
- We enact what exists through boundary-drawing
- Our dispositions construct Markov blankets
- "Getting it right" means achieving low brittleness through successful computational closure

### 5.2 The Holistic Web of Blankets

Markov blankets form a web:
- Blanket A's active states affect Blanket B's sensory states
- B's responses change A's environment
- No blanket's ontology stands alone
- Changing one boundary forces neighboring blankets to reconfigure

This is Quinian holism at the ontological level: adjustments ripple through the entire web of boundaries. Paradigm shifts are massive blanket reconfigurations.

### 5.3 Ontological Pluralism and Constraint

**The Radical Implication:**
There is no view-from-nowhere. Every ontology is blanket-relative:
- Particles exist for blankets organized to detect particles
- Persons exist for blankets organized to detect persons
- Numbers exist for blankets organized to detect patterns

**But This Isn't Pure Relativism:**
Reality imposes constraints. Some blanket configurations generate catastrophic brittleness:
- Geocentrism requires endless epicycles (high P(t))
- Phlogiston theory fails systematic prediction (information leakage)
- Flat-earth models collapse under navigational pressure

The Apex Network is the set of boundary configurations that achieve genuine computational closure with minimal brittleness. Different cultures may reach it via different paths, but extreme misalignment with constraint structure gets selected against.

### 5.4 Three Levels of Reality-Making

**Local:** Individual Markov blankets creating personal ontologies
- My notion of "friend" draws boundaries based on my experience
- These boundaries make certain people "friends" for me

**Regional:** Complexes of blankets creating shared ontologies
- Cultural notions of "friendship" emerge from overlapping individual blankets
- Creates intersubjective reality through convergent boundary-drawing

**Global:** The entire web creating consensus reality
- Scientific ontology emerges from systematic convergence under shared constraints
- The Apex Network as thermodynamic attractor for optimal blanket configurations

But per Quine, these aren't separate levels—they're aspects of one holistic process of boundary-making.

## 6. Integration with the Main Framework

### 6.1 Connecting to Systemic Brittleness

Notions, dispositions, and phantasms illuminate the micro-mechanisms underlying systemic brittleness:

**Patch Velocity P(t):**
- Failed notions requiring constant revision
- Dispositions that consistently generate prediction errors
- Blankets that cannot maintain computational closure

**Coercive Overhead C(t):**
- Energy spent maintaining rigid blankets against disconfirming evidence
- Pathological complexes requiring active suppression of information
- Information blindness as blanket impermeability

**Model Complexity M(t):**
- Baroque dispositional structures from failed compression
- Multiple incompatible notions requiring elaborate coordination
- Inability to achieve parsimonious coarse-graining

**Resilience Reserve R(t):**
- Breadth of information streams successfully compressed
- Number of independent blankets converging on same boundaries
- Robustness of dispositions across contexts

### 6.2 Standing Predicates as Crystallized Notions

The main text defines Standing Predicates as "reusable conceptual tools" and "Markov Blankets." This appendix shows the genetic process:

1. **Repeated Experience** → Notion forms (dispositional compression)
2. **Pragmatic Testing** → Disposition generates predictions
3. **Low Brittleness** → Disposition reliably minimizes surprise
4. **Linguistic Crystallization** → Notion becomes articulated predicate
5. **Social Transmission** → Predicate adopted across individuals
6. **Historical Vindication** → Predicate achieves Standing status

Standing Predicates are successful compressions—notions that survived pragmatic selection and became cultural infrastructure.

### 6.3 The Negative Canon as Dispositional Graveyard

Failed notions populate the Negative Canon:
- Phlogiston: Disposition to explain combustion via substance loss
- Miasma: Disposition to attribute disease to bad air
- Epicycles: Disposition to preserve geocentric boundaries

Each represents a blanket configuration that could not maintain computational closure. The brittleness metrics track the costs of maintaining these failing dispositions before they were abandoned.

### 6.4 Individual Agency Recovered

This account preserves individual agency within systemic dynamics:

**Individuals as Variation Engines:**
- Each person's unique experience generates unique dispositional structures
- Novel notions emerge from idiosyncratic blanket configurations
- "Genius" = disposition to draw boundaries others haven't tried

**Reality as Selection Mechanism:**
- Constraint landscape determines which dispositions survive
- Pragmatic pushback eliminates high-brittleness blankets
- Convergence emerges from independent agents facing shared constraints

The Apex Network is discovered through distributed experimentation with different dispositional structures, not centrally planned.

## 7. Implications and Open Questions

### 7.1 For Epistemology

**Traditional:** Beliefs are mental representations assessed for correspondence to reality

**Dispositional:** Beliefs are compressed patterns assessed for their success at minimizing prediction error and brittleness

This shift from representational to enactive epistemology has profound consequences for understanding justification, truth, and objectivity.

### 7.2 For Philosophy of Mind

**The Hard Problem:** How does subjective experience arise from physical processes?

**Dispositional Response:** Phenomenology is what it feels like from the inside of a successfully bounded information system. Emotions are the dashboard reading variational free energy. Consciousness may emerge at certain scales of Markov blanket hierarchies.

### 7.3 For Metaphysics

**Traditional:** What fundamentally exists? (Particles? Fields? Substances?)

**Dispositional:** What blanket configurations achieve genuine computational closure?

Ontology becomes engineering: the search for boundaries that enable stable, predictive, low-complexity dynamics.

### 7.4 Open Challenges

**The Binding Problem:**
How do separate dispositions cohere into unified notions? What determines which associations "stick together"?

**The Creative Leap:**
How do genuinely novel notions emerge? What triggers the transition from vague disposition to explicit conception?

**The Normative Gap:**
This account is descriptive—but notions can be wrong. How do we distinguish reality-tracking dispositions from mere prejudice?

**The Social Scaffold:**
How does language provide pre-formed channels for dispositional development? How does cultural transmission shape notion-space?

## 8. Conclusion: A Naturalized Account of Conceptual Structure

This appendix has shown that the gap between sensation and belief—the "mystery" of how concepts form—admits a naturalistic explanation through information theory and Markov blanket formalism. Notions are compression algorithms, dispositions are prediction engines, and phantasms are proto-boundaries awaiting pragmatic crystallization.

This framework:
- **Naturalizes** concept formation without eliminativism
- **Mechanizes** emergence without mystification
- **Unifies** epistemology, philosophy of mind, and metaphysics
- **Preserves** individual agency within systemic dynamics
- **Explains** both convergence (shared constraints) and pluralism (multiple viable blankets)

The main text's claim that "consciousness emerges from nested dispositional patterns" and that "we are not merely bundles of dispositions but can become aware of our dispositional states" now has explicit grounding. Awareness is what it feels like to be a meta-blanket monitoring lower-level dispositional structures. Knowledge is the optimization of these structures for minimal brittleness.

The journey from sensation to Standing Predicate is a journey from noise to signal, from raw information flux to compressed, validated, transmissible conceptual technology. Notions are the intermediate forms—the working hypotheses of an embodied mind searching for viable boundaries in a constraint-rich world.
