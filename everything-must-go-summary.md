This is a comprehensive summary of **"Every Thing Must Go: Metaphysics Naturalized"** by James Ladyman and Don Ross (with contributions from David Spurrett and John Collier).

The book is a polemical work that argues for a radical restructuring of metaphysics. It rejects contemporary "analytic" metaphysics as pseudo-scientific and proposes a new worldview called **Information-Theoretic Structural Realism (ITSR)**, grounded entirely in contemporary physics and mathematics.

### Part 1: The Destruction of "Neo-Scholastic" Metaphysics
The authors begin by attacking the dominant mode of contemporary analytic metaphysics, which they label **"Neo-Scholasticism."**

**1. The Critique of "Domestication"**
*   **The Charge:** Standard metaphysics attempts to "domesticate" science—forcing scientific discoveries to fit intuitive, pre-scientific conceptual frameworks to make them "understandable" to the layman.
*   **The Containment Metaphor:** Philosophers (and "folk" intuition) wrongly view the world as a container filled with little "things" (self-subsistent individuals) that interact via "microbangings" (causal collisions).
*   **The Failure of Intuition:** The authors argue that human intuitions evolved for social navigation and medium-sized object manipulation, not for understanding the deep structure of the universe. Therefore, a priori conceptual analysis and "intuitions" have **zero evidentiary weight** in metaphysics.

**2. The Principle of Naturalistic Closure (PNC)**
To replace the reliance on intuition, the authors propose a strict methodological constraint:
*   **The PNC:** Metaphysics should only be motivated by the attempt to unify specific scientific hypotheses. Any metaphysical claim that is not connected to the unification of two or more specific scientific hypotheses should be rejected.
*   **The Primacy of Physics Constraint (PPC):** Special science hypotheses (biology, psychology, etc.) must not contradict fundamental physics, but fundamental physics need not respect the categories of special sciences.

### Part 2: Structural Realism and Physics
The authors build their positive ontology by engaging with the philosophy of science, specifically the debate between **Scientific Realism** and **Constructive Empiricism**.

**1. The Problem with Standard Scientific Realism**
*   **Pessimistic Meta-Induction:** History shows that scientific theories change radically. The "objects" posited by past theories (e.g., ether, caloric) do not exist. Therefore, we cannot believe that the "objects" of current theories (e.g., electrons) truly exist as described.
*   **Underdetermination:** The authors argue that standard realism about "things" is indefensible because physics often allows for multiple formulations that are empirically equivalent but posit different local ontologies.

**2. The Solution: Ontic Structural Realism (OSR)**
To save realism, the authors adopt **Structural Realism** (originally proposed by John Worrall): We should believe in the *structure* preserved across theory change, not the *entities*.
*   **Against Epistemic Structural Realism (ESR):** ESR claims there *are* objects, but we can only know their structure. The authors reject this as a distinct metaphysical commitment with no scientific utility.
*   **Affirming Ontic Structural Realism (OSR):** The authors argue that **structure is all there is.** There are no "things-in-themselves" or self-subsistent individuals that "have" the structure. Relations are ontologically primary; relata (objects) are secondary abstractions.

**3. Evidence from Physics**
The authors argue that modern physics forces us to abandon the idea of "individuals":
*   **Quantum Mechanics (QM):** Quantum particles are indistinguishable. In entangled states, particles possess relational properties without possessing intrinsic state-independent properties. They cannot be individuated as distinct "things" in the classical sense.
*   **General Relativity (GR):** The "Hole Argument" suggests that spacetime points are not individuals; they are defined entirely by their relational (metric) structures.
*   **Conclusion:** Fundamental physics describes objective modal structures, not a world of discrete "microbangings" between discrete "little things."

### Part 3: Rainforest Realism and the Unity of Science
If fundamental physics says there are no "things," how do we account for the tables, chairs, and organisms of the special sciences?

**1. Rainforest Realism (RR)**
The authors reject Quine’s "desert" landscape (parsimonious ontology) in favor of a "rainforest."
*   **Scale Relativity:** Ontology is scale-relative. What exists depends on the scale at which you interrogate the universe.
*   **Real Patterns:** Adopting Daniel Dennett’s concept, they argue that **"to be is to be a real pattern."**
    *   A pattern is real if it is **projectible** (supports counterfactuals/predictions).
    *   A pattern is real if encoding it compresses information relative to a "bit-map" of the data.
*   This allows everyday objects (tables) and special science entities (inflation, ecosystems) to be **real**, even if they are not fundamental. They are real patterns located at specific scales.

**2. The Unity of Science**
*   **Fundamental Physics:** Studies **Universal Real Patterns** (patterns that hold at all scales and everywhere in the universe).
*   **Special Sciences:** Study **Local Real Patterns** (patterns that exist only at specific scales and in specific regions, e.g., biology exists only where evolution occurs).
*   The special sciences are not reducible to physics (because computational intractability prevents deriving macro-patterns from micro-physics), but they are constrained by physics (PPC).

### Part 4: Causation and Information
The final component of their metaphysics deals with causation, a concept the authors view as problematic in fundamental physics.

**1. The Eliminativism of Russell**
They endorse Bertrand Russell’s (1913) critique: Fundamental physics does not contain "causes." It contains mathematical functional dependencies.
*   There is no "biff" or "oomph" in physics.
*   The universe may be a "Block Universe" (static spacetime) where fundamental temporal asymmetry (required for causation) does not exist.

**2. Causation as a "Notional World" Concept**
*   While causation isn't in fundamental physics, it is essential for the special sciences.
*   Causation is a **locator**: It is a bookkeeping tool used by agents with limited cognitive access (like humans) to track real patterns in a world where they cannot see the whole picture.
*   Because we are embedded in a region of the universe governed by the Second Law of Thermodynamics (entropy), we experience asymmetry. This allows us to use causal heuristics to track patterns.

**3. Information-Theoretic Structural Realism (ITSR)**
*   The authors synthesize OSR and Rainforest Realism into **ITSR**.
*   **The World:** The world is not made of matter or spirit, but of **Information** (understood objectively as logical depth/compressibility).
*   Structure is objective modal relations (necessity/possibility).
*   Scientific laws describe these real patterns (informational structures).

### Summary of Key Philosophical Moves

1.  **Naturalization:** Reject all metaphysics not directly motivated by unifying science.
2.  **Elimination of Individuals:** Use Quantum Mechanics and General Relativity to show that "objects" (individuals) do not exist at the fundamental level.
3.  **Ontology as Structure:** Replace "things" with "relational structures."
4.  **Real Patterns:** Reintroduce macroscopic objects not as fundamental things, but as "Real Patterns" (information-theoretically efficient compressions of data).
5.  **Demotion of Causation:** Relegate causation from a fundamental feature of the universe to a pragmatic tool for special sciences, deriving from local thermodynamic conditions.
6.  **The Result:** A unified worldview where the universe is a nexus of information-theoretic structures, with no fundamental "stuff" or "things" at the bottom.
