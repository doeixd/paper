\abstract{Dennett's real-pattern realism links ontology to compression and prediction, but compression alone is too permissive: contrived codings and dynamically idle aggregates can satisfy it. This paper argues that the missing ingredient is an explicit closure condition. A candidate macro-object qualifies when, for a fixed regime, horizon, and admissible intervention class, macrostate information is sufficient for macro-transitions, so within-class micro-differences do not change macro-level what-follows. In exact Markov settings, strong lumpability provides a benchmark realization of this condition. In non-ideal settings, closure is graded through leakiness and convergent diagnostics under fixed constraints. The result is realist but disciplined: it excludes high-leak composites, supports graded verdicts in borderline cases, and remains compatible with microphysical completeness. By tying commitment strength to robustness under anti-gerrymandering tests, the framework explains why selective realism is principled rather than discretionary.

\section{Introduction: Why Pattern Realism Needs a Stricter
  Criterion}\label{introduction-why-pattern-realism-needs-a-stricter-criterion}

Dennett's core thought is still compelling. Scientific and everyday
inquiry often succeeds by tracking patterns rather than exhaustively
tracking microstates, and this success is not always reducible to
convenience language. His criterion is explicit: ``A pattern exists in
some data---is real---if there is a description of the data that is more
efficient than the bit map, whether or not anyone can concoct it''
\citep[p. 34]{dennett1991}. In that sense, real-pattern realism captures
something correct about the structure of explanation.

The persistent difficulty is permissiveness. Dennett himself anticipates
the crudest version of this worry: a coding scheme that simply
``baptizes'' individual frames with proper names achieves no genuine
compression, because it collapses to the full bit map whenever the
target extends beyond the memorized cases \citep[pp. 32--33]{dennett1991}.
His response is that the coding must be part of an entirely general
system, not an ad hoc renaming trick. That constraint excludes the most
obvious cheats. But it does not close the gap. A coding strategy can be
genuinely general and non-trivially compressive while still grouping
together microstates whose onward transition profiles diverge. Such
constructions compress, yet they require persistent within-class
bookkeeping to maintain forecast quality, precisely because the
macro-label hides transition-relevant heterogeneity. This is the
residual permissiveness that survives Dennett's own anti-cheating move,
and it is the target of the present paper.

The worry has a well-established lineage beyond Dennett's initial
discussion. Haugeland pressed the question of when pattern detection
crosses from descriptive convenience into genuine ontological contact
\citep{haugeland1998}, and versions of the ``cheap coding'' objection recur
throughout the subsequent literature \citep{elgin2017}. The present paper
takes that critique seriously: residual permissiveness, not the trivial
kind Dennett already blocks, is the central obstacle standing between
real-pattern realism and a defensible macro-ontology.

A contrast makes the gap concrete. Lewis observed that we have no
principled reason to deny existence to the mereological sum of ``the
right half of my left shoe plus the moon plus the sum of all her
Majesty's ear-rings,'' however sensible it is to ignore such things in
ordinary thought \citep[p. 213]{lewis1986}. That is correct as far as it
goes. But consider the difference between that composite and a
hurricane. Knowing a hurricane's pressure organization and rotational
structure tells you what it will do next without tracking every
molecule. The shoe-moon composite carries no comparable transition
structure; predicting its future requires independently tracking each
component. What separates them is not existence but autonomous
macro-dynamics. This paper argues that closure of transition structure
is the criterion that marks that difference.

The thesis, then, is that real-pattern realism needs an explicit closure
condition to avoid permissive drift.

For a fixed regime, horizon, and admissible intervention class, a
candidate macro-object qualifies when macrostate information is
sufficient for macro-transitions, so within-class micro-differences do
not change macro-level what-follows.

This thesis is a tightening move, not a replacement project. Existing
pattern realism captures compression and projectibility insights. The
present contribution adds a discriminating condition that excludes
gerrymandered candidates by transition structure rather than by
intuitive naturalness. The formal benchmark for this condition is strong
lumpability in exact Markov settings. The non-ideal extension is graded
closure via leakiness and convergent diagnostics under fixed
constraints.

The argument is philosophical, not a methods paper in disguise. The
paper does not claim to deliver a universal estimation recipe. It
provides a criterion and a disciplined protocol for applying it.
Estimator selection, finite-sample behavior, and domain-specific
implementation remain downstream methodological tasks.

\subsection{Novelty and Positioning}\label{novelty-and-positioning}

The novelty claim has three parts.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item
	      Beyond Dennett alone: compression realism is retained, but
	      permissiveness is reduced by an explicit anti-gerrymandering
	      condition.
	\item
	      Beyond formal closure results alone: strong lumpability is used as a
	      benchmark for an ontological criterion, not only as a mathematical
	      property.
	\item
	      Beyond pure interventionist pragmatism: admissibility is fixed
	      upstream and physically constrained, so verdicts are not back-fit to
	      analyst preference.
\end{enumerate}

This is a conditional metaphysical proposal. Under structural realist
and interventionist commitments, closure under admissible conditions is
sufficient for macro-objecthood in regime. Readers with different priors
can still accept a narrower conclusion: closure is at least a necessary
anti-gerrymandering constraint on serious macro-ontology claims.

This positioning is deliberately dialogical. With Dennett, the paper
keeps compression realism while rejecting permissiveness \citep{dennett1991}. With Ladyman and Ross, it keeps structural and projectibility
ambitions while insisting on an explicit transition criterion for
objecthood verdicts \citep{ladyman2007}. With Rosas, it treats
formal closure diagnostics as benchmark machinery, then uses them to
support a philosophical criterion that remains stable in non-ideal cases
\citep{rosas2024}. With causal-emergence work, it treats macro-level
gains as corroborating diagnostics rather than as a standalone ontology
test \citep{hoel2013}. With Kim-style exclusion pressure, it defends
non-redundancy at explanatory and control levels without denying
microphysical implementation \citep{kim1998}.

A related line of work traces the cognitive origins of real-pattern
commitments, linking predictive coding and free-energy minimization to
how bounded agents build and revise their representational schemes
\citep{gladziejewski2025}. That work helps explain why agents converge on
some macro-descriptions and abandon others, which strengthens the
anti-arbitrariness side of pattern realism. But representational success
can remain task-relative unless a further test determines when a
candidate grouping tracks dynamical structure in the world rather than
merely serving local inferential needs. The closure criterion supplies
that additional test.

A stronger reading of Dennett is worth confronting directly. One can
interpret real-pattern realism as already requiring projectibility and
cross-context robustness, not merely compression in a single dataset.
On that steelman, Dennett's criterion already excludes fragile,
narrowly-tuned codings. Even so, projectibility constrains which
predictions are worth tracking; it does not test whether the
macro-description carries autonomous transition structure. A partition
can be projectible across contexts and still require persistent
within-class micro-bookkeeping to sustain its forecasts, because the
macro-label groups together microstates whose onward profiles diverge
once perturbation or horizon extension is applied. Closure catches
exactly that residual failure mode. It asks not only whether a pattern
projects, but whether macro-level what-follows is self-contained at the
declared grain. That is the gap even the most charitable reading of
Dennett leaves open.

In short, projectibility can still tolerate successful forecasting that
depends on recurring micro-level repair. Closure does not.

\subsection{Scope and Non-Claims}\label{scope-and-non-claims}

The paper is restricted to induced closure in spatiotemporal systems. It
does not offer a complete metaphysics of levels, and it does not settle
all questions about abstract objects or full mereology. Where those
debates arise, they are handled only to protect the central claim from
predictable misreadings.

Methodologically, the paper does not depend on the strongest
anti-analytic rhetoric sometimes associated with naturalized
metaphysics. The claim is narrower: closure is a usable philosophical
constraint that can be motivated by dynamical and coarse-graining
practice, whether or not one accepts every meta-metaphysical commitment
in the broader ETMG program \citep{ladyman2007}.

The roadmap is direct. Section 2 states the criterion and admissibility
framework. Section 3 gives the exact benchmark. Section 4 extends the
criterion to non-ideal settings. Section 5 addresses the strongest
objections. Section 6 summarizes gains and limits.

\subsection{Three Nearby Positions}\label{three-nearby-positions}

It helps to separate three nearby stances that are often run together.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item
	      Compression-prediction realism: successful compression and forecasting
	      are treated as sufficient for realist commitment.
	\item
	      Pure pragmatism: model choice is guided by utility alone, with no
	      ontological consequence.
	\item
	      Closure realism: compression and prediction matter, but objecthood
	      requires transition autonomy under fixed regime, horizon, and
	      admissible intervention class.
\end{enumerate}

The third stance preserves the explanatory strengths of the first while
avoiding its permissiveness. It also avoids reducing ontology to
convenience, which is the pressure on the second.

\subsection{Contribution Map}\label{contribution-map}

The paper makes three linked contributions.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item
	      It gives a criterion-level tightening of real-pattern realism by
	      adding closure as a discriminating objecthood condition.
	\item
	      It provides a bridge from exact benchmark cases to non-ideal cases
	      without changing criterion content.
	\item
	      It offers a disciplined verdict structure with explicit downgrade
	      conditions, so realism claims remain answerable to failure.
\end{enumerate}

The central payoff is selective commitment. The framework can support
strong commitments where transition autonomy is robust, while avoiding
forced commitments where evidence is fragile or regime-sensitive.

\section{Closure and Admissibility}\label{closure-and-admissibility}

\subsection{Criterion in Plain
	Language}\label{criterion-in-plain-language}

Closure can be stated without heavy formalism. A candidate macro-object
passes when knowing its current macrostate is enough to determine
macro-level what-follows over a specified horizon and intervention
class. If two microstates inside one macrostate produce different
macro-transitions, closure fails at that grain.

The key point is dynamic. The criterion concerns transition sufficiency,
not mere descriptive fit. A representation can summarize trajectories
elegantly and still fail objecthood if it requires persistent
within-class micro-bookkeeping to preserve forecast quality.

\subsection{Formal Statement}\label{formal-statement}

Let micro-process be \(X_t\) and candidate macro-process be
\(Z_t = g(X_t)\). For horizon \(L\), closure asks whether \(Z_t\) is
sufficient for forecasting \(Z_{t+1}^{L}\) under a fixed regime and
admissible intervention class.

The horizon object here is the \(L\)-step path distribution, not only
one-step prediction. One-step tests can be used as diagnostics, but
objecthood claims are indexed to the declared horizon target.

Informationally, the predictive side asks whether adding \(X_t\) beyond
\(Z_t\) yields material gain for macro-future prediction.
Interventionally, the causal side asks whether macro-transition laws
remain stable across admissible perturbations without needing
within-class micro-identification.

These are not competing tests. They are two readings of the same target:
transition autonomy at the macro level.

\subsection{Why This is More Than
	Compression}\label{why-this-is-more-than-compression}

Compression is necessary but not sufficient for objecthood. A compressed
code can hide transition-relevant heterogeneity and still score well on
narrow tasks. Closure blocks that loophole by asking whether hidden
heterogeneity matters for macro-level what-follows.

This is why closure functions as an anti-gerrymandering condition. It
does not reward convenient coding alone. It rewards coarse-grainings
that carry stable transition structure under declared constraints.

Put differently, this paper accepts Dennett's claim that compression
success is evidence of objective patterning, but denies that compression
success is the full ontological test \citep{dennett1991}. It also accepts
Ladyman and Ross's concern that real patterns should be projectible and
structurally disciplined, while adding an explicit transition criterion
for adjudicating borderline cases \citep{ladyman2007}. The aim is
not to replace those insights. The aim is to make their realist force
less permissive.

This also answers a familiar Haugeland-style pressure point. The paper
does not infer objecthood directly from ``there is a useful pattern in
the data.'' It adds an explicit transition-autonomy condition that
determines when pattern talk has ontological force rather than merely
descriptive convenience \citep{haugeland1998}.

\subsection{Admissibility and Hierarchical
	Evaluation}\label{admissibility-and-hierarchical-evaluation}

Closure is always relative to an intervention class. The standard
objection is that this invites circularity. The response is procedural
and hierarchical.

Admissibility is fixed upstream of objecthood verdicts by three
constraints:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item
	      Epistemic admissibility: interventions are measurable and
	      implementable by bounded agents.
	\item
	      Dynamical admissibility: interventions preserve the target regime
	      class.
	\item
	      Explanatory admissibility: interventions target variables with
	      cross-context generalizability and non-trivial counterfactual reach,
	      rather than one-off manipulations tuned to a single episode.
\end{enumerate}

These constraints are physically anchored in available control channels
and implementation structure. They are not analyst preferences about
favored ontologies. The explanatory constraint is set before closure
verdicts and does not assume in advance which candidate partition will
prove stable. This makes the interventionist notion of a ``possible
experiment'' concrete and bounded, rather than leaving it at conceptual
possibility where nearly any hypothetical manipulation might count
\citep{woodward2015}. This aligns with \citet{woodward2021}'s argument
that correct variable choice is a matter of satisfying
``proportionality''---minimizing the omission of dependency relations.
The procedure constrains judgment without
eliminating it: domain expertise still shapes regime identification and
control-channel selection, but that shaping is declared, auditable, and
separated from partition scoring.

Operationally, explanatory admissibility can be audited without looking
at which partition wins. A candidate intervention class is stronger when
it is implemented through control channels that already exist in the
domain and are replicable across sites, operators, or runs. It is weaker
when success depends on narrow, one-off tuning that fails under small,
feasible perturbations of the same intervention family.

A related distinction matters here. Pearl defends the $do(x)$ operator
as an ideal ``surgery'' that can be defined mathematically regardless of
physical feasibility \citep{pearl2000}. For causal inference, that
idealization is productive: it lets one reason about effects even when
direct manipulation is unavailable. But macro-objecthood requires
tighter constraints than logical derivation. A partition that achieves
closure only under physically unrealizable interventions, ones that no
bounded agent could implement without destroying the target regime, does
not support the kind of stable, intervention-guiding structure that
warrants realist commitment. The admissibility constraints above ensure
that closure is assessed relative to control channels that are actually
available in the regime, not relative to arbitrary mathematical
surgeries. This is not a rejection of Pearl's framework. It is a
restriction on which of its outputs carry ontological weight.

Evaluation order matters.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item
	      Fix regime, horizon, admissible intervention class, diagnostics, and
	      model class.
	\item
	      Compare candidate partitions under those fixed constraints.
	\item
	      If constraints are revised after inspecting results, restart and
	      disclose the revision.
\end{enumerate}

This order blocks back-fitting and makes disagreement tractable. If
verdicts remain highly sensitive across nearby defensible admissibility
specifications, commitment should be downgraded.

A structural worry deserves explicit treatment here. If regime
individuation already commits to which macro-variables matter, the
protocol risks a version of circularity: closure testing presupposes
regime identification, but regime identification might presuppose
partition outcomes. The response is that defensible regime
specifications draw on quantities characterizable without presupposing
which candidate partition will succeed. Temporal parameters, energy
scales, flow rates, and enforcement intensities are typically
identifiable through physical indicators that competing candidate
partitions can agree on before either is evaluated. In the traffic
illustration, ``weekday commuter traffic in one metropolitan corridor''
is characterized by clock schedules, total vehicle counts, and road
network topology, all quantities that investigators favoring either the
lane-flow or vehicle-ID-cluster partition can agree on before either
closure test is run. Regime specifications of this kind are anchored in
lower-level or cross-cutting physical indicators rather than in the
outcome of the very test they enable. The key principle is that regime
specifications should be grain-neutral across competing candidate
partitions: a regime can itself be a macro-level description while
still not presupposing which finer-grained partition will close
within it.

The independence is imperfect in some domains, particularly biology and
social science, where macro-variable choice and regime characterization
can be genuinely entangled. The framework treats that entanglement as a
source of evidential weakness rather than a concealed defect. When
alternative, independently motivated regime specifications produce
divergent closure verdicts, the verdict ceiling should be downgraded to
at most qualified. More broadly, regime individuation and partition
evaluation should be understood as iterative rather than viciously
circular: initial regime characterizations are provisional, closure
testing can refine them, and the process stabilizes into reflective
equilibrium, in the sense Goodman articulated: rules of inference and
particular inferential judgments are justified by their mutual coherence
rather than by either serving as the unilateral foundation for the
other \citep{goodman1955}. If iteration does not stabilize across nearby
defensible starting specifications, the result should be treated as
indeterminate for that regime rather than forced into a robust verdict.
The discipline comes from requiring that all revisions be disclosed and
that each revision restart the evaluation rather than silently inheriting
prior results.

\subsection{Pattern Reality Versus
	Macro-Objecthood}\label{pattern-reality-versus-macro-objecthood}

One distinction is essential for avoiding confusion. A pattern can be
real in a weaker sense without satisfying this paper's objecthood
criterion. A representation can capture regularities that are
descriptively useful while still failing closure under admissible
interventions.

The criterion in this paper is stricter. It targets macro-objecthood,
not any and every projectible summary. This is why the paper can
preserve a generous attitude toward pattern detection while denying
ontological standing to high-leak candidates.

The same distinction also clarifies what this framework contributes to
composition debates. In van Inwagen's terms, the standing question is
when some things compose a further thing \citep{vaninwagen1990}. The
present proposal does not offer a full mereology. It gives a
domain-indexed discipline condition: composition claims about
macro-objects are warranted when transition autonomy is robust under
declared constraints, and should be withheld when candidate sums remain
transition-fragile.

That distinction clarifies dialectical burden. The paper does not need
to show that non-closed representations are worthless. It only needs to
show that they do not meet the objecthood standard defended here.

\subsection{Admissibility Disputes}\label{admissibility-disputes}

Admissibility disputes are expected, especially across domains. The
adjudication rule is to compare candidate intervention classes by what
they physically permit and whether they preserve the same target regime.
Boundary-pressure perturbations can be admissible for storm dynamics,
while molecule-by-molecule remote rewriting is not. In institutional
settings, changing enforcement intensity can be admissible, while
instant arbitrary rewriting of all agent commitments is not. The
ontological consequence is direct. A storm satisfies closure under
boundary perturbations because its pressure organization and rotational
structure determine macro-transitions without tracking individual
molecules. Under molecule-by-molecule rewriting, the same candidate
fails, because admissibility now permits interventions that reach inside
the macroclass and exploit within-class differences. The candidate has
not changed; the admissible control channel has, and the verdict changes
with it. This is why admissibility must be declared and justified before
scoring, not adjusted afterward to protect a preferred outcome.

For transparency, three template classes are often useful as a starting
grid: boundary nudges, coarse actuator controls, and policy levers.
These templates are not universal, but they make admissibility
comparison public and repeatable.

One guardrail is non-negotiable. Interventions that directly target
preservation of partition labels, rather than system variables, are
inadmissible because they trivialize closure by design. The test
concerns whether transition structure is autonomous under physically
meaningful controls, not whether labels can be protected by stipulation.

When two intervention classes are both admissible and target the same
regime, the framework permits plural testing rather than forced monism.
Verdicts should report which admissibility class was used and how
sensitive results are across nearby defensible classes. A candidate
partition that appears closed only under one narrowly tuned class should
be downgraded when sensitivity appears across nearby defensible
alternatives.

\subsection{Canonical Criterion
	Statement}\label{canonical-criterion-statement}

For ease of reference, the core criterion can be stated compactly:

A candidate coarse-graining \(Z=g(X)\) qualifies for macro-objecthood in
regime when, under fixed horizon \(L\) and admissible intervention class
\(\mathcal{I}\), macro-transition structure is autonomous up to declared
tolerance, so within-class micro-differences do not materially improve
macro-future prediction or intervention-guided control.

Candidate partitions must be specified independently of the particular
sample trajectory used to score closure, for instance by a pre-declared
construction rule or learning objective fixed before evaluation.
Otherwise closure collapses into bespoke encoding, where any dataset can
be made to look autonomous by post hoc recoding.

In exact Markov settings, strong lumpability is a sufficient benchmark
realization of this criterion. In non-ideal settings, leakiness-centered
diagnostics estimate distance from that ideal under fixed constraints.

\subsection{Predictive and Interventional
	Closure}\label{predictive-and-interventional-closure}

Predictive and interventional closure should be distinguished but not
separated. Predictive closure concerns whether macrostate information
screens off transition-relevant micro-detail for macro-future
forecasting. Interventional closure concerns whether macro-transition
structure remains stable under admissible perturbation.

The evidential relation is asymmetric. Strong interventional closure
typically implies predictive adequacy for the same target and horizon,
while predictive adequacy alone can persist in cases where
interventional stability fails under distribution shift. This is why the
criterion treats predictive evidence as important but not final.

This asymmetry also clarifies burden of proof. Claims to robust
macro-objecthood need either direct interventional support or compelling
indirect evidence that tracks intervention-relevant invariance.
Otherwise, the responsible verdict is qualified or indeterminate.

\subsection{Why Closure Carries Ontological
	Weight}\label{why-closure-carries-ontological-weight}

A reviewer can still ask why transition autonomy should count as
objecthood rather than as a mere success condition for modeling. The
answer depends on the paper's explicit commitments. Under structural
realism, what ontology should track is stable relational and causal
organization rather than intrinsic micro-identity as such. Under
interventionism, what counts as causally relevant structure is structure
that supports stable manipulation and control.

The meta-philosophical stance here follows what Woodward calls the
methodological path to ontology: causal-interventionist tools are used
to determine what earns realist commitment, rather than seeking
independent metaphysical ``truth-makers'' or ``grounds'' that stand
apart from the practices of manipulation and prediction \citep{woodward2015}. This is not a retreat to instrumentalism. It is the claim that
scientific ontology, disciplined by closure, is the only ontology
required for macro-objecthood verdicts. The demand for a further
metaphysical foundation beyond stable dynamical autonomy under
admissible intervention mistakes a philosophical habit for a substantive
requirement.

Given those commitments, closure does not function as a convenient
heuristic layered on top of ontology. It is the criterion that
identifies when a candidate macro-description tracks stable structure at
the level where explanation and intervention are being assessed. This is
why the framework can remain compatible with microphysical completeness
while still defending non-redundant macro commitment.

The connection to Pearl's notion of modularity is worth noting. Pearl
argues that causal models work because nature consists of autonomous
mechanisms: changing one structural equation need not disrupt the others
\citep{pearl2000}. Closure is related to this property but not identical to
it. Pearl treats modularity as a structural assumption about a given
causal model; the present criterion asks a prior question, namely
whether a candidate coarse-graining has earned the right to appear as a
variable in such a model at all. A partition that requires persistent
micro-bookkeeping to preserve its transition structure has not isolated
an autonomous mechanism at the macro grain in the relevant sense. So
closure can be understood as an ontological precondition for the kind of
modularity Pearl's framework presupposes, rather than as a restatement
of it.

This is also why the proposal is not vulnerable to standard ``bare
structure'' worries. The criterion is modal and dynamical, not merely
extensional. It is about counterfactual transition organization under
interventions, not about abstract isomorphism alone.

This also addresses Newman-style triviality pressure in structural
realism \citep{ainsworth2009}. Extensional structure alone can be cheap under recoding.
Closure is not extensional fit alone. It requires transition and
intervention stability under declared constraints, which arbitrary
recodings typically fail.

Why not stop at ``good variable'' language? Because a good variable can
be merely convenient, and the worry is that closure only tracks
inferential convenience rather than what is objectively there. The
framework rejects that deflation because closure claims are indexed to
intervention classes, not only to passive prediction. A representation
can score well on retrospective fit by exploiting accidental
correlations and still fail quickly when admissible interventions shift
transition pathways. A closure-supporting partition survives those
shifts because the screened-off structure is not accidental. If a
candidate supports reliable counterfactual control and regime-stable
transition laws, it is tracking objective modal structure: stable
counterfactual dependencies and lawlike transition regularities under
admissible intervention. On the paper's commitments, treating that
structure as merely representational would undercut the very realism the
framework is designed to preserve. The modal profile, not the in-sample
fit, carries the ontological burden. Predictive sufficiency can reveal
compression, but interventional stability identifies difference-makers:
it tests whether the same macro-transition structure survives admissible
manipulation rather than merely fitting observed trajectories.

The framework therefore distinguishes epistemic humility from
ontological deflation. Finite agents will often have partial, noisy, and
regime-limited evidence. But that uncertainty does not collapse the
difference between dynamically autonomous and dynamically incoherent
partitions. That difference can be difficult to estimate, but it is
still a difference in the world rather than in preference.

\subsection{Levels of Claim and
	Representation}\label{levels-of-claim-and-representation}

Some recurring misunderstandings come from sliding between different
levels of claim. The paper uses the following distinction throughout.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item
	      World dynamics: the implemented process itself.
	\item
	      Pattern type: stable transition structure supported by that process.
	\item
	      Pattern token: a concrete instance under specific boundary conditions.
	\item
	      Representation: a model, equation, classifier, or narrative that
	      tracks the pattern.
\end{enumerate}

A representation can fail while the pattern type remains real. A token
can fail while the type remains robust. A token can also succeed while
the type is weak, for example in narrow calibration windows. Closure
claims in this paper are primarily type-level claims under specified
regimes, then secondarily claims about token reliability under
perturbation.

This is why the criterion does not equate model performance with
ontology. It asks whether the represented transition structure is
genuinely autonomous, not whether one representation currently performs
well.

\subsection{Closure, Underdetermination, and Objecthood
	Discipline}\label{closure-underdetermination-and-objecthood-discipline}

One remaining concern is underdetermination. Even after the criterion is
stated, a reviewer may argue that many distinct coarse-grainings can be
tuned to look acceptable on available data. If so, closure might seem to
collapse back into model choice rather than objecthood discipline.

The framework's answer is to separate three questions that are often
conflated.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item
	      Which candidate partitions are descriptively serviceable in a dataset?
	\item
	      Which candidates remain transition-autonomous under admissible
	      perturbation?
	\item
	      Which of those candidates remain stable under modest horizon and
	      admissibility variation?
\end{enumerate}

Underdetermination is strongest at the first question and weaker at the
second. It is often weakest at the third. Many candidates can fit
observed trajectories. Far fewer preserve counterfactual structure when
the regime is probed. Fewer still remain stable across nearby defensible
setups. This staged filtering is exactly where closure earns its
metaphysical role.

The framework does not claim that every domain yields one uniquely
privileged partition. It claims that objecthood commitments should be
constrained by transition autonomy and robustness, rather than by fit
alone. When underdetermination persists after those filters, the
responsible result is qualified or plural commitment under transparent
constraints, not forced monism and not unconstrained relativism.

Before moving to the formal benchmark, the framework can be summarized
in three lines.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item
	      \textbf{Criterion:} macro-objecthood requires transition autonomy
	      under fixed regime, horizon, and admissible intervention class.
	\item
	      \textbf{Evaluation:} when exact closure fails, leakiness-centered
	      diagnostics estimate comparative distance from closure.
	\item
	      \textbf{Commitment rule:} commitment strength tracks evidential
	      stability, with explicit downgrade to qualified or indeterminate
	      status when evidence is unstable.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Exact Benchmark: Strong
  Lumpability}\label{exact-benchmark-strong-lumpability}

Strong lumpability is introduced as a benchmark, not as destiny. It
gives a clean exact case in Markov settings where closure can be stated
and checked without ambiguity.

Let partition cells under \(g\) be macroclasses. Strong lumpability
holds when microstates within the same macroclass induce identical
transition probabilities to all macroclasses \citep{kemeny1960}. When this condition holds,
macro-transitions are autonomous by construction.

More precisely: for any two microstates \(x, x'\) in macroclass \(C_i\),
and any macroclass \(C_j\), strong lumpability requires
\(\sum_{y \in C_j} P(y \mid x) = \sum_{y \in C_j} P(y \mid x')\).

\textbf{Lemma.} If the micro-process is first-order Markov and the
partition induced by \(g\) is strongly lumpable, then the induced
macro-process is itself Markov and transition-autonomous at the macro
level.

\emph{Proof sketch.} Define a macro-kernel by summing micro-transition
probabilities from any representative \(x \in C_i\) into each macroclass
\(C_j\). Strong lumpability guarantees this sum is
representative-independent. The macro-kernel is therefore well-defined,
and the induced process over macroclasses is Markov with transitions
given by that kernel.

The philosophical significance is straightforward. A partition that
satisfies this condition is not merely useful. It preserves transition
structure at the macro grain. A partition that fails it mixes
transition-heterogeneous microstates and therefore lacks macro autonomy.

Equivalent language from computational mechanics clarifies why this is
not superficial bookkeeping. For any macro-process \(Z\), two prediction
machines can be defined. The \(\varepsilon\)-machine is the minimal
model that predicts \(Z\)'s future from \(Z\)'s own past, using only
macro-level information. The \(\upsilon\)-machine is the minimal model
that predicts \(Z\)'s future from the full micro-past \(X\), using
everything available \citep{shalizi2001,rosas2024}.
Closure holds when these two machines are equivalent: the
\(\varepsilon\)-machine already captures everything the
\(\upsilon\)-machine knows about macro-futures, and extra
micro-information is redundant for the macro target. This gives an exact
ideal where closure is not approximate.

The important limitation is equally clear. Exact strong lumpability is
uncommon in open, noisy, and path-dependent systems. That limitation
motivates the graded extension. It does not undermine the criterion.

\subsection{Minimal Formal
	Illustration}\label{minimal-formal-illustration}

The anti-gerrymandering role can be shown with a minimal symbolic
example. Let microstates be \(\{x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4\}\) with transition
rows:

\[
	\begin{aligned}
		P(x_1,\cdot) & = (\alpha,\beta,0,0),  \\
		P(x_2,\cdot) & = (\alpha,\beta,0,0),  \\
		P(x_3,\cdot) & = (0,0,\gamma,\delta), \\
		P(x_4,\cdot) & = (0,0,\gamma,\delta),
	\end{aligned}
\]

with \(\alpha+\beta=1\) and \(\gamma+\delta=1\).

Partition \(A\) groups \(\{x_1,x_2\}\) and \(\{x_3,x_4\}\). Partition
\(B\) groups \(\{x_1,x_3\}\) and \(\{x_2,x_4\}\). In \(A\), members of
each macroclass have matching onward profiles to macroclasses, so
macro-transitions are autonomous. In \(B\), members of one macroclass
differ in onward profiles whenever \(\alpha \neq \gamma\), so the
macro-label hides a transition-relevant difference.

Partition \(B\) can still be made predictive by adding repeated
within-class bookkeeping. That is exactly the high-maintenance case this
paper excludes from robust macro-objecthood.

The philosophical lesson is simple. Both partitions are definable. Only
one preserves transition autonomy. Closure therefore discriminates
between legitimate macro-candidates and merely codable aggregates.

\subsection{If an Unusual Partition
	Closes}\label{if-an-unusual-partition-closes}

A common reaction is that a strange disjunctive partition might satisfy
the formal condition in a symmetric system. That is correct. On this
framework, if such a partition genuinely supports autonomous
macro-transitions under fixed constraints, it counts as real at that
grain.

This is not a concession to arbitrariness. The criterion tracks
transition coherence, not intuitive naturalness. If one wants a separate
naturalness filter, that is an additional criterion and should be
declared as such.

The exclusion claim should therefore be read carefully. The framework
excludes dynamically incoherent, high-leak aggregates. It does not
exclude every unusual grouping.

\subsection{What the Formal Machinery Alone Does Not
	Provide}\label{what-the-formal-machinery-alone-does-not-provide}

The mathematical property and the philosophical criterion are different
things. Four elements of the present framework have no counterpart in
the formal literature alone.

First, intervention indexing. Causal-state constructions classify
histories by equivalence of future distributions under the observed
process, which is primarily an observational-predictive equivalence
relation \citep{shalizi2001}. The present criterion adds an
admissible intervention class as a parameter of the closure test.
Objecthood claims are indexed to what the system does under
perturbation, not only under passive observation. This is what separates
the criterion from a purely statistical diagnostic.

Second, an explicit ontological interpretation. Strong lumpability tells
you when a coarse-graining preserves transition structure. It does not
tell you whether that preservation warrants realist commitment. The
philosophical work is to argue that, under stated commitments,
transition autonomy under admissible interventions is sufficient for
macro-objecthood, and to give the conditions under which that claim
should be downgraded or withdrawn.

Third, a graded commitment protocol. The formal literature offers exact
conditions and, more recently, approximate-closure measures. It does not
supply a framework for translating those measures into warranted
ontological verdicts with explicit robustness requirements and downgrade
rules. The selective commitment structure (robust, qualified,
indeterminate) is a philosophical addition.

Fourth, an anti-gerrymandering argument. The argument that closure is
the right anti-gerrymandering condition, and that compression without
closure is insufficient for objecthood, is not a theorem. It is a
philosophical claim defended by the structure of Sections 2 through 4.

A similar point applies to causal-emergence work. Effective-information
analyses identify when macro-descriptions gain determinism relative to
micro-descriptions \citep{hoel2013}. That is a valuable diagnostic,
but a partition can increase effective information while remaining
fragile under intervention or horizon variation. The present framework
treats such gains as corroborating evidence within a closure-governed
criterion, not as a standalone ontology test.

So the paper is not computational mechanics or causal-emergence analysis
with new labels. It is a philosophical criterion that borrows formal
tools while adding intervention-indexed objecthood conditions, an
explicit commitment protocol, and a sustained argument about why closure
is the right fix for pattern-realism's permissiveness problem.

\section{Approximate Closure Without Instrumentalist
  Drift}\label{approximate-closure-without-instrumentalist-drift}

\subsection{Why Approximation is
	Expected}\label{why-approximation-is-expected}

In complex systems, boundaries leak and couplings shift across regimes.
Exact closure is therefore unusual. A credible realism criterion cannot
require perfect closure everywhere. The mathematical study of
approximate aggregation has a long history, especially in analyses of
nearly decomposable systems \citep{ando1961}. The present extension
is philosophical rather than technical. It uses graded closure to
support graded ontological verdicts, not to improve estimation.

Approximation here is not concession to arbitrariness. It is the
expected non-ideal form of the same criterion, provided constraints are
fixed and diagnostics are comparative.

The right ontology test is type-level before token-level. A pattern type
can be robustly closed for a regime even when a specific token fails
because of boundary violation, atypical perturbation, or timescale
mismatch. One anomalous token is therefore not decisive. The relevant
question is whether failures are exceptional or systematic for the type
under the stated constraints. Systematic failure, where within-class
micro-differences repeatedly matter for macro-transitions across tokens
under fixed constraints, is what triggers type-level downgrade rather
than token-level exception.

\subsection{Leakiness as Canonical
	Target}\label{leakiness-as-canonical-target}

Leakiness measures how much within-class micro-detail still improves
macro-future prediction once current macrostate is fixed. A canonical
quantity is \(I(X_t; Z_{t+1} \mid Z_t)\) \citep{cover2006}. Low values support closure.
High values indicate hidden transition-relevant heterogeneity.

In this paper, leakiness is the default target quantity. Other
diagnostics, such as within-class transition divergence and predictive
gain from added micro-features, function as estimators or proxies when
direct estimation is limited.

Leakiness should therefore be read comparatively and through robustness
checks, not as a context-free absolute cutoff. Absolute tolerance is
domain-relative, but high sensitivity of leakiness rankings to modest
defensible modeling choices is itself a downgrade trigger.

Comparative ranking is necessary but not sufficient. A candidate can
beat nearby alternatives and still fail objecthood if absolute leakiness
remains high and instability persists under modest robustness checks.
The framework therefore requires both relative superiority and minimum
viability.

The viability floor can be stated without a numeric threshold. A
partition fails minimum viability if, across the declared robustness
checks, within-class micro-features yield consistent, non-negligible
gains in macro-future prediction or intervention response relative to
the best macro-only model. When that pattern persists across diagnostics
and perturbation tests, the partition has not achieved the transition
autonomy the criterion requires, regardless of how it ranks against
competitors.

The term ``non-negligible'' can be given a comparative anchor without
fixing a universal numeric threshold. Leakiness is most clearly
non-negligible when adding within-class micro-features yields prediction
gains comparable in magnitude to the gains the macro-partition itself
provides over a naive baseline model. If the macro-partition delivers
substantial predictive improvement over no partition at all, and
within-class micro-features add only marginal further gain, that
residual leakiness is negligible for most objecthood purposes. If
micro-features instead add gains approaching or matching the
macro-partition's own contribution, the partition is not doing most of
the relevant work, and minimum viability is not met. This framing makes
the judgment about a single tractable quantity, namely relative
predictive contribution, rather than an abstract absolute cutoff, and it
makes cross-domain comparisons more tractable. The two requirements work
in sequence: the viability floor is applied first as a minimum gate,
excluding candidates regardless of how they compare to rivals, while
comparative ranking then assigns verdict categories among candidates that
pass it. To keep this anchor non-discretionary, the baseline model class
and gain metric must be fixed upstream with regime and admissibility,
and post hoc revisions trigger restart and disclosure.

Verdict-category boundaries carry genuine vagueness because the
underlying property of transition autonomy is itself graded. This is a
feature rather than a defect: biological fitness is real and
explanatorily significant without admitting a sharp boundary between fit
and unfit. What matters primarily is ordering stability. When partition
$A$ consistently shows lower leakiness and greater perturbation
stability than partition $B$ across diagnostics, that ordering should be
robust even if the exact placement of the boundary between ``qualified''
and ``robust'' carries some domain-conventional element. A partition
that dominates alternatives across diagnostics and remains stable under
modest changes to horizon, intervention distribution, and robustness
checks earns the stronger verdict regardless of where one draws the
categorical line.

\subsection{Procedural Safeguards in Non-Ideal
	Cases}\label{procedural-safeguards-in-non-ideal-cases}

Approximate closure claims require explicit safeguards.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item
	      Fix regime, horizon, admissibility class, and diagnostics before
	      comparative scoring.
	\item
	      Compare candidate partitions under the same fixed setup.
	\item
	      Test robustness under modest changes in horizon and intervention
	      distribution.
	\item
	      Apply a minimum-viability floor: if all candidates remain high-leak
	      and fragile, return no robust objecthood verdict for that regime.
	\item
	      Report verdicts as robust, qualified, or indeterminate.
\end{enumerate}

This keeps threshold choice procedural rather than discretionary. It
also addresses a predictable confusion. Estimation difficulty is an
epistemic limit on access, not a defect in the metaphysical criterion
itself.

\textbf{Selection discipline.} One concern from both reviewers and
readers is that flexibility can silently re-enter through upstream
choices. The framework answers this with a single discipline rule:
admissibility, state construction, horizon, and diagnostics are fixed
before scoring, and post hoc revisions trigger restart and disclosure.
This does not eliminate judgment. It makes judgment auditable and
prevents favored partitions from being protected by moving criteria.

\subsection{Regime Dependence and
	Projectibility}\label{regime-dependence-and-projectibility}

Regime dependence does not imply observer-relativity. It states that
closure depends on actual transition structure under specified
constraints. A pattern can be closed in one regime and leaky in another
because the structure has changed.

The metaphysical stance is explicit: regime and horizon index the modal
profile being claimed, not a concession that anything goes.

Projectibility provides a further check. Defensible regime
specifications should support stable induction under modest
counterfactual variation. Narrowly engineered regimes that protect a
favored partition usually fail under small context shifts. When that
occurs, the candidate was never robustly closed in the relevant sense.

This is where the paper is closest to Ladyman and Ross. Projectibility
is not treated as an optional methodological virtue. It functions as a
realism-relevant stress test on whether a closure claim survives beyond
calibration conditions \citep{ladyman2007}. Closure without
projectible robustness is too cheap to support robust objecthood claims.

Regime dependence itself should be split into two forms. Ontic regime
dependence occurs when system structure changes, such as phase
transitions or boundary-condition shifts. Epistemic regime dependence
occurs when measurement or control access changes while underlying
structure remains fixed. The first changes what is there to be tracked.
The second changes what can be warranted from available evidence.

\subsection{One Distributed
	Illustration}\label{one-distributed-illustration}

Macro does not mean large or spatially contiguous. Coarse-graining can
be logical and distributed. Monetary systems illustrate this point
without requiring new machinery.

The macro-transition structure of transactions can remain stable across
heterogeneous micro-realizations, such as cash tokens, ledger records,
and digital balances, under admissible legal and financial
interventions. If that stability holds, macro-objecthood is warranted in
regime. If implementation channels degrade, closure can fail even while
symbolic representations persist.

A minimal failure case clarifies the point. A state can retain formal
legal tender rules while losing reliable payment enforcement and
settlement implementation. In that case, the representation persists but
transition autonomy degrades, and closure-based commitment should be
downgraded.

Organisms give a complementary illustration. In many physiological
regimes, membrane and regulatory organization screen off large amounts of
molecular variation for the target transitions, so intervention on
organ-level variables remains predictively and manipulatively effective.
When those screening structures fail, for instance under severe systemic
breakdown, the same macro-description can become leaky and require
finer-grained tracking. The point is not that organism talk is always
closed. The point is that closure can be regime-robust without being
regime-universal.

Across these illustrations, the verdict structure does real
discriminative work. The monetary example in a well-functioning system
approaches robust objecthood in the declared regime: macro-transition
structure remains stable across heterogeneous realizations and admissible
interventions. The organism example falls into the qualified range:
within established physiological regimes, membrane organization and
regulatory control screen off large amounts of molecular variation,
making organ-level interventions reliably effective, but leakage appears
at ecological or pathological boundaries where those screening structures
degrade. The failed-implementation case
represents a downgrade: formal representations persist while transition
autonomy erodes, warranting withdrawal of robust commitment. The three
cases illustrate the verdict categories in operation, not as abstract
labels but as outcomes determined by the same diagnostic criteria applied
to different evidential situations.

The illustration does one job only. It shows that closure tracks
transition structure, not spatial shape. Nothing in the argument depends
on taking a stance on broader social ontology.

\subsection{Failure Conditions and Downgrade
	Rules}\label{failure-conditions-and-downgrade-rules}

The framework should also say clearly when commitment should be
withdrawn or downgraded. Four failure patterns are especially relevant.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item
	      Persistent high leakiness across defensible diagnostics under fixed
	      constraints.
	\item
	      Strong disagreement among diagnostics that does not resolve under
	      modest robustness checks.
	\item
	      High sensitivity of verdicts to small, defensible changes in
	      admissibility or horizon.
	\item
	      Candidate sets where every partition remains above the
	      minimum-viability floor.
\end{enumerate}

When these patterns appear, the right response is not forced binary
judgment. The right response is explicit downgrade to qualified or
indeterminate status. This keeps the criterion resilient without
pretending that every case must produce a sharp ontology verdict.

Type-token reminder: a downgraded token does not automatically refute
type-level closure. The key question is whether instability is
exceptional at token level or systematic for the type under the stated
constraints.

\subsection{Stable Versus Merely Entailed
	Patterns}\label{stable-versus-merely-entailed-patterns}

The graded framework also supports an important distinction. A pattern
can be entailed by microhistory and laws without being stable as a
macro-handle. Entailment alone is cheap. Stability under admissible
perturbation is demanding.

This distinction matters for permissiveness debates. A contrived
disjunctive construction can be true of a realized trajectory while
still failing closure. It can require continual within-class micro
repair, fail under modest regime shifts, and lose interventional
reliability.

A historical case makes the pattern concrete. Phlogiston theory
compressed combustion phenomena under a single macro-variable, but the
partition required persistent bookkeeping to survive: when metals gained
weight upon burning, theorists introduced ``negative phlogiston''; when
different substances showed different weight changes, further ad hoc
parameters appeared. Each patch was a new within-class distinction
imported to preserve macro-prediction. By contrast, oxygen theory
required no such ongoing repair: the macro-variable (oxidation state)
screened off the relevant chemistry without persistent bookkeeping. The
critique here is structural, not retrospective ridicule. A candidate
that continually imports corrections to preserve macro-prediction
behaves like a non-autonomous partition, and the closure framework
detects this failure directly.

So the claim is not that gerrymandered constructions are false. The
claim is that they usually fail to qualify as macro-objects. They may
remain descriptions, but not object-level descriptions in the relevant
regime. The same applies to computationally adequate models more
broadly. A higher-level model can be useful for prediction or control
without meeting closure standards. Computational adequacy means the
model serves some purpose; closure requires that transition-relevant
micro-differences are screened off in the specified regime. A
computationally adequate but high-leak representation remains a valuable
tool, but it does not automatically earn macro-object status.

\subsection{Practical Qualification Under Sparse Intervention
	Access}\label{practical-qualification-under-sparse-intervention-access}

In many domains, direct interventions are sparse, ethically constrained,
or expensive. This does not invalidate the criterion. It changes
evidential strategy.

Where intervention data are limited, predictive closure functions as an
operational indicator while interventional closure remains the
ontological target. A model can fit historical trajectories and still
fail under novel perturbation. For that reason, claims should be
qualified by available intervention access and downgraded when
out-of-regime behavior is unstable.

The paper therefore does not treat in-sample prediction as decisive. The
standard remains robustness under admissible perturbation, even when
that robustness must be assessed indirectly.

This point also explains why diagnostics should be triangulated.
Predictive closure can look strong in-sample while interventional
closure fails under admissible perturbation. Partial observability can
hide within-class heterogeneity that later appears as instability.
Nonstationarity can make a previously low-leak partition unstable
outside its calibration window. Triangulation does not remove these
risks, but it makes them visible.

\subsection{Conceptual Contrast: Near-Tie Prediction, Different
	Ontology
	Verdicts}\label{conceptual-contrast-near-tie-prediction-different-ontology-verdicts}

Two partitions can show similar short-horizon observational performance
and still receive different closure verdicts. This is where the
criterion does real philosophical work.

Suppose partition \(P_1\) and partition \(P_2\) produce comparable
one-step observational fit in calibration data. Under fixed admissible
interventions, \(P_1\) preserves stable macro-transition structure while
\(P_2\) requires repeated within-class micro refinements to maintain
performance. Observationally, they may look close. Structurally, they
are not.

On the present framework, \(P_1\) receives the stronger objecthood
verdict because it remains transition-autonomous under the fixed
constraints. \(P_2\) can remain useful as a representation, but its
dependence on recurring hidden repair counts against macro-object
standing.

A concrete sketch helps. In traffic modeling, one partition may track
density and flow by lane segment. A rival partition may track arbitrary
vehicle-ID clusters that happen to fit one week of observations.
In-sample one-step fit can be similar. Under admissible perturbations,
such as ramp metering changes and speed-limit adjustments, the lane-flow
partition remains stable while the ID-cluster partition becomes brittle.
Under modest horizon extension, leakiness for the ID-cluster partition
rises sharply. The verdict is then robust or qualified objecthood for
the lane-flow partition and downgrade for the rival.

Mini-walkthrough under the reporting schema:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item
	      Target partitions: $P_{lane}$ (lane-segment density and flow)
	      versus $P_{id}$ (vehicle-ID clusters).
	\item
	      Regime and horizon: weekday commuter traffic in one metropolitan
	      corridor; horizon set to short-run control windows and one modest
	      extension beyond calibration.
	\item
	      Admissibility class: control channels that traffic operators
	      actually use in that regime (ramp metering and speed-limit
	      controls), excluding interventions that require implausible
	      vehicle-level actuation.
	\item
	      Diagnostics: predictive gain from within-class microfeatures,
	      within-class transition-profile divergence, and intervention
	      response invariance under admissible perturbations.
	\item
	      Verdict: $P_{lane}$ remains comparatively stable and earns robust
	      or at least qualified objecthood in the declared regime; $P_{id}$
	      remains instrumentally useful in calibration but is downgraded once
	      perturbation and modest horizon extension are applied.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Reporting and Evidential
	Discipline}\label{reporting-and-evidential-discipline}

To keep conclusions comparable across cases, closure assessments should
report five items explicitly.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item
	      Target partition and rationale.
	\item
	      Regime and horizon specification.
	\item
	      Admissible intervention class and justification.
	\item
	      Diagnostics used and their agreement or disagreement.
	\item
	      Final verdict category: robust, qualified, or indeterminate.
\end{enumerate}

This reporting structure is simple, but philosophically important. It
prevents silent shifts in target, timescale, or admissibility from being
mistaken for genuine ontological progress.

For consistent application, the assessment sequence should be explicit.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item
	      Specify candidate partitions for one target process.
	\item
	      Fix regime, horizon \(L\), admissible intervention class
	      \(\mathcal{I}\), diagnostics, and model classes in advance.
	\item
	      Evaluate all candidates comparatively under that same fixed setup.
	\item
	      Report verdict category and sensitivity under modest perturbation
	      checks.
\end{enumerate}

This sequence is not an optional implementation preference. It is part
of what makes closure claims epistemically disciplined rather than post
hoc.

Diagnostics do not replace criterion-level argument. They provide
evidence about whether a candidate satisfies the criterion under
declared constraints. This distinction matters because reviewers can
otherwise misread the framework as reducing ontology to whichever metric
happens to be available. The evidential logic is comparative and
convergent. No single proxy is treated as infallible. Confidence
increases when different diagnostics track the same rank-order among
candidate partitions and when those rankings remain stable under modest
perturbation tests. Confidence decreases when diagnostics diverge
persistently or when rankings are brittle under small design changes.

This is why verdict categories are graded. Robust verdicts require
convergence and stability. Qualified verdicts fit mixed but non-trivial
evidence. Indeterminate verdicts fit persistent instability. The
diagnostic set can vary by domain, but it should answer one fixed
question: do within-class micro-differences still matter for
macro-what-follows? In practice, three checks are usually enough.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item
	      Leakiness proxy based on predictive gain from added within-class
	      micro-features.
	\item
	      Within-class transition-profile divergence.
	\item
	      Intervention-response invariance under admissible perturbation.
\end{enumerate}

Agreement across these checks increases warrant. Persistent disagreement
is evidence for revision or downgrade, not for forced commitment. When
interventional evidence is sparse or unavailable, the remaining
diagnostics can still support qualified status, but robust objecthood
requires that the interventional leg not be entirely missing.

Minimal triangulation recipe: require stability under modest horizon
variation and under at least two defensible admissibility perturbations,
while at least two diagnostics agree on candidate rank-order. If this
condition fails, return qualified or indeterminate status rather than
robust objecthood.

\section{Objections and Replies}\label{objections-and-replies}

The objections are organized as a progression from foundational worries
to evidential-discipline worries. The order is deliberate, but the core
answer remains stable: closure under fixed constraints supplies
ontological discipline without demanding a single privileged descriptive
level.

Three standing commitments apply throughout the replies below and will
not be restated each time. First, the framework does not deny
microphysical completeness; it claims non-redundancy at the explanatory
and interventional level for declared macro-targets. Second, all
verdicts are indexed to regime, horizon, and admissible intervention
class, so objections that presuppose context-free ontological claims
address a view the paper does not hold. Third, the strongest conclusion
is conditional on structural realist and interventionist commitments;
readers who withhold those commitments can still accept the narrower
anti-gerrymandering result.

\subsection{``Instrumentalism and
	Admissibility''}\label{instrumentalism-and-admissibility}

Objection: target selection is interest-relative, so the view still
collapses into usefulness.

Reply: target selection can be interest-shaped without making closure
verdicts preference-shaped. Once regime, horizon, and admissibility are
fixed, whether macro-transitions are autonomous is a system fact under
explicit constraints.

The stronger version invokes Dennett's Martian. If an ideal
micro-predictor can forecast everything, macro realism looks optional.
The mistake is to infer ontological redundancy from representational
power. Micro omniscience can coexist with objectively better macro
bottlenecks for target dynamics. Refusing those bottlenecks increases
representational burden. It does not erase macro transition structure.

The deeper point is that observer power changes convenience, not closure
facts. Whether a partition is transition-autonomous under fixed
constraints does not vary with who computes it.

Admissibility version of the same objection: admissibility criteria
already encode what counts as the relevant level. The framework answers
this by hierarchical order and disclosure rules. Admissibility is fixed
by physically realizable, regime-preserving control channels before
partition scoring. Post hoc admissibility revision triggers restart.
This makes back-fitting explicit and sanctionable.

Residual disagreement can remain. The framework does not promise
universal convergence from one pass. It promises disciplined comparison
and explicit downgrade when verdicts are unstable across nearby
defensible admissibility specifications. This is a feature for skeptical
readers: hard cases are flagged as unresolved rather than settled by
stipulation.

Instrumentalist pressure hides in two forms: ontology should track
predictive utility only, or ontology is unnecessary once predictive
utility is available. The framework rejects both. Utility without
closure is too permissive, and closure without ontology understates what
stable intervention-guiding structure provides. What closure adds is not
metaphysical extravagance. It is commitment discipline. If a candidate
repeatedly supports stable counterfactual control under fixed
constraints, refusing any ontological standing starts to look like an
empty verbal policy rather than a substantive alternative. The paper
does not force maximal realism. It forces explicit criteria for when
anti-realism remains credible.

This is also where the cheap-coding objection is handled directly. A
recoding can improve local fit and still fail closure under admissible
perturbation. The criterion is therefore representation-hostile in
exactly the way permissiveness critiques demand.

\subsection{``Causal Exclusion Still Defeats Macro
	Claims''}\label{causal-exclusion-still-defeats-macro-claims}

Objection: if microphysics is causally complete, macro-level causal
claims are redundant \citep{kim1998}.

Reply: closure does not posit a second fundamental cause layer. It
identifies when macro-description is sufficient for prediction and
intervention at the relevant target level. Microphysical implementation
remains untouched.

The non-redundancy claim is explanatory and control-theoretic. A closed
macro-partition carries autonomous transition structure for target
dynamics. In that respect, macro-level variables are not placeholders
for arbitrary omitted micro-details. They are level-appropriate carriers
of intervention-relevant structure.

This reply aligns with interventionist causation. Macro-level
interventions can be successful and projectible across perturbations
without denying microphysical realization \citep{woodward2003,pearl2000}.
Compatibility with microphysical completeness is a design feature, not a
concession.

The overdetermination worry can be handled directly. The framework does
not claim two independent sufficient causes at one event. It claims one
implemented process with multiple adequate descriptions for different
explanatory and control targets. Exclusion pressure weakens once
adequacy is indexed to target and intervention class rather than to a
single privileged descriptive level.

This leaves a clear limit in place. The paper does not claim that every
macro-description is causally on par with every micro-description. It
claims that when closure conditions are met, macro-level variables earn
non-redundant standing for the relevant explanatory and interventional
tasks. That is the level of commitment needed to answer exclusion
pressure in its strongest contemporary form \citep{kim2005}.

The framework does not infer macro-causal relevance from semantic
convenience or explanatory taste. It ties relevance to
intervention-guiding difference-making under fixed constraints. If
intervening on macro-variables systematically shifts target outcomes
while micro-identity within macroclasses does not add control leverage,
exclusion-style redundancy claims lose force for that target.

Relative to Kim's strongest formulations, the key move is
target-indexing rather than layer multiplication \citep{kim1998,kim2005}. A
closed macro-description can be non-redundant without competing for
micro-level fundamentality, because non-redundancy is inferred when
micro-detail ceases to add control-relevant information for the target
outcome under fixed constraints. This is not a linguistic escape. It is
a claim about which counterfactual dependencies remain stable for a
declared class of interventions. Compatibility with microphysical
completeness by itself is too weak to do this work, because it leaves
open whether macro-variables are dispensable shorthand. Closure narrows
that space: when it holds, dispensability must be argued against a
stated record of interventional and predictive sufficiency, not simply
asserted.

\subsection{``Autonomy, Pluralism, and
	Distinctiveness''}\label{autonomy-pluralism-and-distinctiveness}

Objection: the view sounds like a formal restatement of familiar
special-sciences autonomy claims, not a distinctive realism thesis.

Reply: the paper is continuous with autonomy insights, but it is not
equivalent to them. Generic autonomy claims often remain permissive
about what qualifies as a level-worthy grouping. The present view adds a
discriminating closure condition with explicit exclusion and downgrade
rules. That addition changes verdict structure.

The difference is practical and philosophical. Practical, because the
framework gives a protocol for ruling out high-maintenance,
transition-incoherent candidates. Philosophical, because it ties realism
commitment to transition autonomy under admissible interventions rather
than to explanatory convenience alone. In this respect, causal-emergence
style results are treated as evidence within a closure-governed
framework, not as a replacement for the criterion itself \citep{hoel2013}.

The paper should therefore be read as a constrained realism refinement
of autonomy views, not as an unrelated alternative and not as a mere
restatement. The conceptual difference can be stated directly. Generic
autonomy claims assert that higher levels matter. Closure specifies
\emph{when} they matter, \emph{how much} they matter (graded by
leakiness), and \emph{when the claim should be withdrawn} (explicit
downgrade conditions). A realism criterion without withdrawal conditions
is not a criterion at all. It is an assertion.

A more specific comparison is worth drawing. The classical arguments for
the autonomy of the special sciences established that higher-level kinds
can be explanatorily indispensable precisely because they abstract over
heterogeneous micro-realizations \citep{putnam1967,fodor1974}. Multiple
realizability is in fact a structural feature of any genuinely closed
macro-kind: if a partition closes, different microstates within the same
macroclass by construction produce the same macro-transitions, making
the kind multiply realized in the relevant sense. Multiple realizability
is therefore necessary for closure. But it is not sufficient. A purely
extensional claim about kind membership says nothing about the dynamical
coherence of the realizers. A disjunctive aggregate can have
heterogeneous realizers while completely failing closure, because those
realizers can have utterly divergent transition profiles. What closure
adds is the dynamical requirement: the realizers must not only fall
under the same label but must produce the same macro-transitions under
the declared constraints. This gap, between what a kind groups together
extensionally and how those instances behave dynamically, is precisely
where gerrymandered kinds exploit multiple-realizability intuitions
without earning genuine macro-object status. The present framework
formalizes the transition condition that the autonomy tradition always
needed to separate genuine higher-level kinds from merely disjunctive
aggregates \citep{shapiro2000}. The monetary illustration in §4.5
provides a concrete instance: coins, ledger entries, and digital
balances are heterogeneous realizers, but what earns money macro-object
status is not the heterogeneity of realizers but the
transition-equivalence of those realizers under admissible financial
interventions.

Pluralism version of the objection: if multiple grains can satisfy
closure, ontology becomes permissive again. The reply is that plurality
of closed grains does not imply arbitrariness. Once regime, horizon, and
admissibility are fixed, which partitions close is determined by
transition structure, not by analyst choice. When multiple candidates
remain viable, robustness and minimality rank them as an objective
relation among candidates under fixed constraints.

This is a virtue for complex systems, not an embarrassment. Forcing a
single grain in every context would be a stronger and less defensible
claim than the paper needs.

\subsection{``The Markov Template is Too
	Restrictive''}\label{the-markov-template-is-too-restrictive}

Objection: strong lumpability presupposes first-order Markov
microdynamics and excludes memory-dependent systems.

Reply: the criterion is transition sufficiency, not first-order
Markovity. Strong lumpability is an exact benchmark. In memory-bearing
systems, state can be enriched with relevant history and the same
closure question can be asked over that enriched state. This changes
state representation, not criterion content.

Concrete cases make this less abstract. Immune response modeling often
depends on historical exposure profiles, and institutional dynamics
often depend on path-dependent enforcement and trust trajectories. In
both cases, a memoryless state is too thin, but a minimally
history-enriched state can still support closure testing at the target
grain.

Minimality still matters. Enrichment should be the least extension
needed to preserve closure performance under fixed constraints. The
framework also accepts an important edge case: if the minimally
sufficient enriched state approaches micro-level complexity, then
closure may be recovered without meaningful compression. In that regime,
the result is not robust macro-objecthood. It is a warning that no
informative macro-partition has been found at the target grain.

\subsection{``Formal Closure Collapses the View into
	Formalism''}\label{formal-closure-collapses-the-view-into-formalism}

Objection: formal systems are closed by stipulation, so closure cannot
ground empirical objecthood.

Reply: stipulated and induced closure must be separated. Formal systems
can have objective internal closure under constitutive rules. The
present criterion concerns induced closure in implemented spatiotemporal
dynamics. Internal formal coherence does not by itself settle empirical
macro-objecthood claims.

This does not reduce formal systems to arbitrary invention. Formal
systems are invented, but not freely. What counts as intelligible formal
practice is constrained by stable identity conditions, compositional
inference, and coherent consequence. Those constraints explain why
formal work can guide empirical reasoning without itself deciding
empirical objecthood.

No collapse follows. The paper's argument is narrower and clearer:
induced closure is the objecthood criterion for implemented
macro-patterns in regime.

\subsection{``Closure Is Too Strong and Eliminates Most Special
	Sciences''}\label{closure-is-too-strong-and-eliminates-most-special-sciences}

Objection: if closure requires that within-class micro-differences not
matter for macro-transitions, then most special-science kinds will fail.
Biological species, psychological states, and economic categories are
notoriously leaky. The criterion eliminates the ontology it was supposed
to discipline.

Reply: this objection conflates robust objecthood with any objecthood
verdict at all. The framework provides three verdict categories, not
one. Robust objecthood requires stable closure under fixed constraints.
Qualified objecthood fits cases where closure is partial,
regime-limited, or supported by convergent but incomplete evidence.
Indeterminate status fits cases where evidence is too unstable to
warrant commitment.

Most special-science kinds fall into the qualified range, and that is
the correct result. Biological species exhibit substantial transition
autonomy within ecological and evolutionary regimes while leaking at
boundary cases (hybrid zones, ring species, horizontal gene transfer).
Psychological kinds often support predictive and interventional
regularity within clinical or experimental regimes while failing under
broader perturbation. The framework does not eliminate these kinds. It
gives them the status their closure evidence supports: qualified
objecthood with explicit regime limitations, rather than either full
robust status or wholesale elimination.

The objection therefore proves too much. A criterion that granted robust
objecthood to every special-science kind regardless of leakiness would
be the permissive framework this paper is designed to replace. The gain
from graded verdicts is that they match evidential reality rather than
forcing a binary choice between full realism and eliminativism.

\subsection{``Predictive Success and Failure
	Conditions''}\label{predictive-success-and-failure-conditions}

Objection: a model can predict well without warranting ontological
commitment.

Reply: that is correct, and the framework does not deny it. Prediction
alone is not the criterion. The criterion is transition autonomy under
admissible interventions and fixed constraints. Predictive success
functions as evidence only when it aligns with closure diagnostics and
interventional stability.

This point carries two immediate consequences.

First, protocol language has a bounded philosophical role. The paper
includes diagnostics to avoid a familiar failure mode, where a criterion
is asserted but left too unconstrained to guide verdicts. The claim
remains conceptual. Diagnostics do not replace argument. They
operationalize what the argument says should matter.

Second, the framework is falsifiable in its own terms. If candidate
partitions repeatedly fail closure diagnostics across defensible regimes
and admissibility classes, commitment should be withdrawn or downgraded.
The same applies when verdicts are unstable under small, defensible
changes in horizon, admissibility, or diagnostic proxy. A proposal that
cannot risk downgrade is not a serious realism criterion.

The framework does not promise certainty from one metric or
one pass. It promises explicit criteria for when confidence increases,
when confidence should pause, and when commitment should retreat.

\subsection{``Horizon-Relativity Makes the Criterion Too
	Weak''}\label{horizon-relativity-makes-the-criterion-too-weak}

Objection: if closure is indexed to horizon, any candidate can be made
to pass at a short enough horizon.

Reply: horizon indexing is a constraint, not an escape clause. Two
requirements prevent it from becoming one.

First, horizons must be anchored in independently identified timescale
structure in the target domain: known relaxation windows, intervention
latency, control-response periods, or similar physically motivated
temporal features. A horizon chosen only because it makes a favored
partition look closed has no independent standing.

Second, verdicts must survive a modest-extension stability check. A
candidate that passes at horizon $L$ but fails immediately at $L +
	\Delta$ for small, defensible $\Delta$ receives, at best, qualified
status. Robust objecthood requires that closure not be razor-thin in
temporal scope.

Together, these requirements force explicit timescale discipline and
prevent silent switching between incompatible temporal targets. Horizon
flexibility is acceptable when it tracks independently motivated
structure. It is not acceptable when it is introduced only after score
inspection to salvage a preferred partition.

This distinction is central for pre-emption. Critics are right that any
framework can be trivialized if timescales are unconstrained. The
present framework avoids that outcome by tying horizons to ex ante
justification and by requiring modest-extension robustness. If
robustness fails, the verdict downgrades. The criterion does not break.
It reports that the claim was too strong for the evidence.

\subsection{``The Criterion Is Too
	Conservative''}\label{the-criterion-is-too-conservative}

Objection: by demanding closure and downgrade discipline, the framework
may be too conservative and may miss emerging macro-objects.

Reply: conservatism is partly intentional. The paper aims to avoid
premature ontological inflation. Still, the framework is not rigid. It
allows qualified verdicts for emerging patterns when closure evidence is
partial but improving, and it allows verdict revision as regimes
stabilize and intervention evidence accumulates.

So the criterion does not require all-or-nothing maturity before any
commitment. It requires that commitment strength track available closure
evidence. \citet{woodward2021} similarly argues that while minimal
interventionist criteria establish causality, invariance is a graded
virtue. Our criterion of closure can be seen as the dynamical
realization of this: a macro-object is ``proportional'' precisely when
it minimizes the omission of relevant micro-detail. This is a virtue for
dynamic systems where objecthood can be developmental rather than
instantaneous.

This is also where compression and closure reconnect in a non-vacuous
way. Early in a domain's development, compression gains may appear
before robust closure is demonstrated. The framework treats this as
evidential lead, not ontological conclusion. As closure evidence
accumulates, commitment can strengthen. If closure evidence fails to
accumulate, commitment should remain qualified or be withdrawn even when
short-run compression remains attractive. The criterion is therefore
neither eliminativist nor inflationary: it does not deny standing to
emerging patterns, but it does not award standing before the dynamical
evidence warrants it.

\section{Conclusion: A Disciplined Realism
  Claim}\label{conclusion-a-disciplined-realism-claim}

Real-pattern realism is plausible but underconstrained. This paper adds
the missing discriminating condition: closure of macro-transition
structure under fixed regime, horizon, and admissible intervention
class. Strong lumpability provides the exact benchmark. Leakiness and
convergent diagnostics extend the same criterion to non-ideal settings
without changing its content.

What the framework buys is selective commitment. It supports robust
commitment where closure is stable, qualified commitment in borderline
cases, and explicit downgrade where verdicts depend on fragile
admissibility or horizon choices. The proposal is intentionally
middle-range: stronger than compression-only pattern realism because it
adds exclusion and downgrade structure, weaker than a total-level
metaphysics because it is restricted to induced closure in
spatiotemporal systems under declared constraints.

This is also where the view separates itself from eliminativist
pressure. The framework does not treat higher-level descriptions as
fictions by default, and it does not grant them standing by convenience
alone. It asks whether they track stable transition structure under
admissible intervention.

The paper also marks clear limits. It is not a complete metaphysics of
levels and not a universal methods manual. Its contribution is a
philosophical criterion with application discipline. Future work should
test the criterion across domains by comparing candidate partitions
under fixed constraints, rather than by multiplying new concepts. If
rejected, it should be rejected because one rejects its stated
commitments, not because circularity, instrumentalist drift, or scope
ambiguity were left unresolved.
