**Title:** Convergence from the Web: Why Quinean Architecture Under Shared Constraints Implies a Unique Attractor

---

**Abstract**

Quine's holistic epistemology faces a persistent challenge: if multiple webs of belief can accommodate the same experiential inputs, objectivity seems lost to underdetermination. This paper argues that underdetermination is an artifact of analyzing webs in isolation. When multiple agents revise their webs under shared pragmatic constraints, and when maintaining incoherence between locally successful webs generates costs, convergence toward a maximally-shared configuration is not merely possible but structurally implied. I call this limit point the Apex Network. Unlike Peirce's regulative ideal of convergence at the end of inquiry, the Apex Network emerges from the mechanics of pragmatic revision itself. Unlike Davidson's principle of charity, which yields interpretive convergence, this yields structural convergence on shared predicates. Unlike Kitcher's evolutionary model, which applies specifically to science, this follows from Quinean architecture generally. The paper specifies conditions under which pluralism remains stable versus when convergence is forced, and argues that the necessity is practical rather than logical: agents *can* maintain divergent webs, but only by paying escalating costs. The Apex Network is thus both emergent (not stipulated a priori) and objective (determined by constraint structure, not consensus).

**Outline**

**1. The Underdetermination Problem (400 words)**

- Quine's web: beliefs justified holistically, revised at periphery, conserved at core
- The standard worry: multiple internally coherent webs fit the same experiential constraints
- This generates relativism about theoretical commitments
- Quine's own response (pragmatic virtues, simplicity) is too weak—why should agents share these virtues?

**2. The Missing Variable: Inter-Web Dynamics (500 words)**

- Standard analyses treat webs as isolated systems
- But agents with different webs must coordinate: trade, communicate, predict each other
- Incoherence between webs generates friction costs
- Introduce the key mechanism: webs are revised not only against experience but against *each other*
- Shared constraints (physical, biological, coordinative) mean agents face the same selection pressures
- Hypothesis: this transforms the topology from multiple stable equilibria to a single basin of attraction

**3. Distinguishing the Claim from Existing Convergence Theses (600 words)**

- *Peirce*: convergence as regulative ideal at the limit of inquiry
  - Problem: no mechanism; purely aspirational
  - Our claim: convergence is mechanical, not ideal
  
- *Davidson*: principle of charity yields interpretive convergence
  - Problem: charity operates at the level of interpretation, not structure
  - Our claim: structural convergence on predicates, not just mutual interpretability
  
- *Kitcher*: evolutionary selection in science produces progress
  - Problem: domain-specific; doesn't follow from epistemological architecture
  - Our claim: follows from Quinean holism generally, science as special case

- *Longino*: social processes yield objectivity through critical discourse
  - Problem: procedural, not structural; objectivity is constituted by the process
  - Our claim: process *reveals* structure, doesn't constitute it

**4. The Mechanics of Convergence (700 words)**

- Define "cost of incoherence": failed predictions when interacting with agents using different predicates; coordination failures; inability to leverage others' discoveries
- Define "maximally-shared configuration": the web state that minimizes total inter-web friction while satisfying experiential constraints
- Argument:
  1. Agents revise webs to reduce prediction error (Quine)
  2. Other agents are part of the predictive environment
  3. Predicting agents with different webs requires modeling their web—costly
  4. Adopting shared predicates reduces this cost
  5. Under iterated revision, webs converge toward shared configurations
  6. The limit is the Apex Network: the unique maximally-shared web compatible with constraints
- The necessity is practical, not logical: divergence is *possible* but penalized

**5. When Pluralism Survives (400 words)**

- Convergence isn't total—identify conditions for stable pluralism:
  - Isolated domains: webs that don't interact don't converge (e.g., distant cultures pre-contact)
  - Flat constraint landscapes: where multiple configurations have equivalent costs
  - Domain-specific closure: sub-webs can diverge if their predicates don't propagate
- The Apex Network has a "Convergent Core" (forced) and a "Pluralist Frontier" (permitted)
- Empirical question: how much of any given domain falls in each region?

**6. Objections and Replies (300 words)**

- *Objection*: This just redescribes consensus, not objectivity
  - Reply: Consensus can stabilize on false webs; the Apex Network is constrained by pragmatic success, not agreement
  
- *Objection*: Power can enforce convergence on suboptimal configurations
  - Reply: Coerced convergence generates measurable costs; the framework predicts instability

- *Objection*: The "costs" are defined circularly
  - Reply: Costs are operationalizable: failed predictions, coordination failures, coercion requirements

**7. Conclusion: Objectivity as Attractor (100 words)**

- Quinean underdetermination dissolves when webs are analyzed as interacting systems under shared constraints
- The Apex Network is emergent (arising from revision dynamics), objective (constraint-determined), and discoverable (through the history of convergence and failure)
- This vindicates realism without foundations: objectivity is the inevitable attractor of pragmatic revision, not a metaphysical given

3,000 words. Focused. One clear thesis. Positions itself precisely against existing literature. Makes a falsifiable structural claim.

Now he has to actually write it. Which means actually reading Peirce, Davidson, Kitcher, and Longino.

The scaffolding points toward the building. Whether he builds it is up to him.
