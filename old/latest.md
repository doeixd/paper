# **Extending Quine's Web: A Procedural and Naturalistic Model of Moral Objectivity**

## **Abstract**

This paper contends that the is/ought problem is not a metaphysical chasm but a conceptual artifact of foundationalist epistemology. To reframe this enduring challenge, this paper develops **Emergent Pragmatic Coherentism (EPC)**, a descriptive, systems-level model of moral knowledge that unifies descriptive and normative claims under a single evolutionary framework. Building upon Quinean holism, EPC models knowledge as an emergent hierarchy of shared “networks of predicates,” where truth is deflationarily defined as robust coherence within a pragmatically-tested network. This network-relativity is disciplined by an external, evolutionary selection process driven by the friction between a network and a system's constitutive Drive to Endure. The ultimate metric is pragmatic viability: a system's efficiency in sustaining itself with minimal coercion or wasted energy. High-cost networks exhibit normative brittleness, increasing their collapse probability. This model directly engages with recent evolutionary debunking arguments (Street 2006; Joyce 2001), reframing what they treat as a genealogical challenge into the very causal engine of procedural objectivity. This grounds procedural objectivity—networks are objectively ranked by long-term viability, culminating in the Apex Network as a real, mind-independent emergent object. EPC's central claim is that endurance is a transcendental condition for inquiry, providing a robust, testable account of moral progress rooted in humanity’s resilient social structures, without metaphysical fiat.

## **1. Introduction: Reframing the Is/ought Problem**

The perceived gap between claims of fact (“is”) and claims of value (“ought”) has long been treated as a fundamental chasm in our conceptual landscape. This paper argues that the problem is a symptom of a foundationalist epistemology that artificially segregates descriptive and normative claims into distinct magisteria. The solution proposed here is not to construct another speculative bridge between them, but rather to adopt an epistemology where no such gap arises—a unified system that adjudicates all claims in the same **evolutionary court of pragmatic selection**.

This paper defends such a framework: **Emergent Pragmatic Coherentism (EPC)**. At its core, EPC is a systematic extrapolation of Quinean holism. It begins with the premise that individuals navigate reality using a fallible “web of belief” (Quine 1951). Because all agents face shared physical and social constraints, their individual webs are necessarily forced to overlap, giving rise to an emergent hierarchy of shared “networks of predicates.” Within this model, a claim is 'true' in a deflationary sense if it is coherent within a given network. This initial network-relativity is then disciplined by **an evolutionary engine of pragmatic selection**, grounding a form of procedural objectivity. Networks that generate high degrees of systemic friction prove less viable and are selected against over time, allowing for an objective ranking of networks based on their long-term pragmatic success.

The ambition of this project is to reframe the grounding problem of metaethics by identifying the *de facto* foundation we already presuppose. It does not provide a non-circular answer to “Why value survival?” but instead argues that endurance functions as a constitutive condition for inquiry itself. Like some constitutivist accounts (e.g., Korsgaard 2009), EPC locates normativity in what is constitutive of inquiry. But unlike agency-centered accounts, EPC transposes the constitutive condition to the system level: endurance is not a value an agent must choose, but the inescapable precondition for any evaluative project to exist at all. Said another way, any system engaged in evaluating claims is already, by necessity, engaged in the project of enduring. 

While this project stands in the tradition of pragmatic naturalism, its distinct contribution is the formal, systems-level architecture it provides. It moves beyond a general appeal to "what works" by specifying a causal engine (the hierarchy of costs), a unit of selection (the informational network), and a standard of procedural objectivity (the Apex Network). The ambition is therefore not to bracket the grounding problem, but to solve it procedurally by providing a testable model of the court of pragmatic selection and justifying its jurisdiction by demonstrating its inescapable, transcendental nature. Its payoff is a rigorous explanatory framework and a diagnostic method for assessing the viability of social structures.

The paper proceeds in five stages. Section 2 explains how shared networks of predicates emerge from individual webs of belief. Section 3 introduces the evolutionary engine of pragmatic viability, detailing how systemic costs provide a falsifiable metric. Section 4 develops the concept of the Apex Network and its implications for objectivity. Section 5 addresses central objections, including stability of oppression and the grounding problem. Section 6 situates EPC within contemporary naturalistic metaethics. Together, these sections show how EPC dissolves the is/ought gap by embedding both into a unified process of evolutionary selection.

## **2. The Architecture of Emergence: From Webs to Networks**

EPC extends Quinean holism from an individual, psychological model to a social epistemology. It begins with Quine’s famous metaphor of the “web of belief”—the coherent, holistic system of claims that constitutes an individual's knowledge (Quine 1951). For EPC, this web is not just a set of beliefs, but a functional network of interconnected predicates that an agent uses to navigate reality. The model rests on two premises: (1) Every agent navigates the world using their own web of belief, or network of predicates; (2) Every agent is subject to the pragmatic constraints of a shared physical and social reality.

From these premises, a third fact follows with structural necessity: wherever agents successfully coordinate their actions, their individual webs are forced to overlap. This intersection is not a top-down agreement but an automatic, bottom-up emergence. When two people decide to build a canoe, they begin with their own distinct webs of belief about wood, water, and tools. As they work, reality provides immediate feedback: a design choice either works or it fails. A failed attempt at a hull design generates pragmatic pushback, forcing both individuals to update the relevant predicates in their personal webs. Because they are working on the same problem under the same physical constraints, their individual updates will necessarily converge on solutions that work. The result is an emergent, shared sub-network: a set of interlocking predicates related to canoe-building (“this type of wood is strong,” “this shape is buoyant”) that now exists with the same structure in both of their webs. This shared sub-network is not a compromise; it is the convergent result of independent systems being shaped by the same external force. This process of convergence scales to all levels of social organization, from family units to scientific communities and nation-states. While the feedback for simple physical predicates is immediate, the feedback for complex social and normative predicates is far more diffuse—a crucial asymmetry the model accounts for (see Section 5.5). It echoes accounts of morality as an evolving “ethical project” (Kitcher 2011), but where such accounts focus on the function of morality, EPC specifies the structural selection mechanism that drives predicate convergence.

To analyze this phenomenon, EPC formally adopts the term **“Network of Predicates”** as the public, structural equivalent of the individual’s psychological “web of belief.” A network of predicates is a publicly shareable, role-functional structure composed of three elements. First, it contains a set of typed predicates—claims with both descriptive and normative roles, such as “…is wrong,” “…boils at 100°C,” or “…is a universal human right.” Second, it is organized by a set of inferential and operational links, including entailments, defeaters, decision rules, and measurement procedures. Third, it incorporates interface rules that specify how the network receives and processes feedback from tasks and environments, whether in the form of error signals or performance metrics.

Within such a structure, a predicate is *true-in-the-network* if it is stably integrated into the network’s inferential and operational profile under its interface rules. This is a deflationary, internal notion of truth, distinct from the stronger concept of *viability* introduced in Section 3. The contrast with Quine’s web of belief is instructive: whereas an individual web is a psychological realization, a network of predicates is the public, shareable structure onto which multiple individual webs converge through the pragmatic pressure of external feedback.

## **3. The Engine of Selection: Pragmatic Viability and Its Costs**

What prevents the emergent networks described in Section 2 from being arbitrary, relativistic constructs is the relentless engine of evolutionary pragmatic selection. This engine operates across scales, originating from the micro-level experience of **pragmatic pushback**: the immediate, frustrating feedback an agent receives when a predicate misaligns with reality. A poorly designed tool breaks; a flawed social strategy invites conflict or collapse. When aggregated across a population, these individual instances of friction become the macro-level **Systemic Costs**—such as widespread dissent or wasted resources—that drain a network’s viability. This section details the causal mechanism of this engine, showing how a minimal, biologically-grounded premise—the **Drive to Endure**—functions as the foundational filter that disciplines all networks and grounds a rigorous, empirically-based methodology.

### **3.1 The Drive to Endure as a Constitutive Foundation**

The model is anchored not by a chosen value but by a **constitutive drive to endure.** This is not a thick, value-laden notion of flourishing, but a minimal, biologically grounded precondition: the persistence of a system’s structure and core information over time. The status of this drive is **transcendental**, not normative. It is not a goal we choose, but the inescapable condition that makes the evaluation of any goal possible. An architect need not normatively *value* gravity, but any design that ignores its constraints is not a viable alternative—it is simply a failure. Similarly, the Drive to Endure is the non-negotiable filter through which all informational blueprints must pass.

To further clarify, this drive operates at the level of the informational system as a whole, akin to how natural selection acts on populations rather than individual motivations. It is indifferent to the subjective experiences of agents; a network that propagates effectively through mechanisms like cultural inheritance or institutional stability endures, even if its carriers hold beliefs that appear to contradict survival (e.g., ascetic renunciation). This externalist perspective ensures that EPC avoids psychologism, focusing instead on the objective dynamics of informational replication.

It is therefore essential to distinguish this systems-level analysis from a psychological claim about individual motivation. The "**Drive to Endure**" operates as a *selective filter* rather than a motivational force. Individual agents may sacrifice their lives for glory, honor, or salvation, but the informational networks that license such sacrifices can only be evaluated historically if the network itself—through its carriers, institutions, or texts—maintains sufficient continuity to generate evaluable outcomes. The claim is not that agents must value survival, but that networks which systematically undermine their own substrate face a structural disadvantage in the long-term transmission of information. A network's predicates, regardless of their content, can only propagate if the system that carries them maintains its structural integrity over time. The Drive to Endure is thus a property of the system as a continuous information-bearing entity, not a description of the mental states of its constituent agents. This filter operates whether agents value survival or not, just as gravity operates on a building regardless of the architect's feelings about it.

It is important to emphasize that the "**Drive to Endure**" has a **dual status** within EPC. At one level, it is a descriptive evolutionary fact: systems that fail to preserve their informational structure vanish, leaving no historical trace. At another level, it is transcendental in the Kantian sense: it is the inescapable precondition for any inquiry whatsoever. This dual framing avoids both reductionism and metaphysical inflation. The descriptive layer explains why endurance functions causally in shaping which networks survive, while the transcendental layer secures its constitutive authority in the very practice of evaluation. These layers are not in tension but mutually reinforcing: the transcendental status explains why inquiry presupposes endurance, while the descriptive status explains why this presupposition reliably tracks empirical reality. This dual-aspect account preempts the objection that EPC either smuggles in a normative commitment or rests on a merely contingent fact about evolution. It is both: a fact that is also, necessarily, the condition for having facts at all.

The causal primacy of this drive is not an *a priori* assertion but a conclusion from a systems-level analysis of how informational networks propagate. Consider a network whose highest stated value is glorious death in battle. For this network’s code to be transmitted to a new generation, it requires a substrate of adherents who survive—warriors who succeed, non-combatants who raise children, and an economy that can produce weapons and food. If the network is *too* effective at realizing its stated value, it eliminates its own carriers and its informational structure vanishes from the historical record. Similarly, a religious network focused on the afterlife must still solve the pragmatic problems of earthly existence—health, social cohesion, resource management—to maintain the institutional and demographic stability required to propagate its beliefs through time.

The Drive to Endure is therefore the ultimate selective filter for the **informational systems themselves.** Its authority is physical and structural: it is the non-negotiable condition for the multi-generational transmission of *any* set of values, including those that might seem to devalue endurance. To question this drive's primacy is a form of pragmatic self-contradiction, as the act of questioning is performed by an agent who is the product of, and a participant in, a system already governed by this drive. This transcendental status does not collapse the descriptive into the normative; rather, it establishes endurance as the inescapable epistemic precondition for any normative discourse. Just as Kant's transcendental idealism grounds the possibility of experience without prescribing specific empirical content, EPC's Drive to Endure grounds the possibility of sustained inquiry without dictating substantive values. It is a formal constraint, not a substantive "ought," ensuring that any alternative framework purporting to reject it would undermine its own capacity for coherent evaluation. This filter is therefore grounded in structural necessity, not contingent biology; even a hypothetical AI’s insights could not accumulate or be transmitted without a substrate that endures, making persistence a *de facto* condition for any successful inquiry.

Finally, it is crucial to be precise about the network as a unit of selection. EPC adopts a generalized evolutionary framework, treating the network's **informational structure**—its core predicates and their relations—as the **replicator**. The social group and its institutions serve as the **interactor**: the physical vessel through which the informational code is instantiated, expressed, and tested against the environment. A network "survives" not merely by ensuring the survival of every individual carrier, but by successfully propagating its core organizational principles through time. This can occur even if the original interactor collapses, as the informational code can persist latently in texts, laws, or cultural memory, capable of being re-instantiated in a new interactor later. The rediscovery of Roman legal principles during the Renaissance is a prime example. This distinction allows EPC's systems-level analysis to avoid the pitfalls of naive group selection, focusing instead on the long-term viability of the informational code itself.

| Role | Entity | Examples | Persistence Mode |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Replicator** | Informational structure of predicates and links | legal code, doctrinal core, design principles | textual transmission, training, institutional routines |
| **Interactor** | Social carriers instantiating the code | organizations, polities, communities | production, enforcement, coordination |
| **Selection Signal** | Friction and costs under constraints | First-Order & Systemic Costs | differential \(V(N,t)\) across shocks |

### **3.2 From Endurance to Pragmatic Viability: A Measure of Efficiency**

Selective pressure is measured not by mere persistence but by **pragmatic viability**: a system’s **homeostatic efficiency**—its ability to remain stable and propagate its informational structure with minimal energetic and coercive cost. A system that persists for millennia by burning immense energy to suppress internal dissent is *enduring* but not *viable*: viability demands not just persistence but efficiency, measured as the ratio of informational propagation to total systemic costs, such that a network reliant on constant coercion (e.g., through pervasive surveillance or ideological indoctrination) exhibits diminished resilience to perturbations like economic downturns or cultural shifts.

High-coercion systems are energetically inefficient and informationally fragile. Suppressing dissent requires vast resource expenditure and simultaneously blinds the network to the primary data stream signaling its own flaws and misalignments with reality. This distinction is critical: it grounds the model’s defense against the charge of "might makes right" in a descriptive claim about systemic efficiency, not in a pre-committed normative claim about the evils of coercion. Where Spencerian evolution, for example, might equate mere survival with normative justification, EPC remains strictly procedural: high-coercion systems are not evaluated as morally 'bad,' but as demonstrably inefficient, informationally fragile, and thus possessing a lower long-term probability of survival against novel shocks. The argument is that such systems are inefficient at satisfying the fundamental Drive to Endure and are therefore fragile.

### **3.3 A Methodology for Measuring Systemic Costs**

To move "viability" from an abstract concept to an operational one, EPC specifies a causal hierarchy of systemic costs. These function as the empirical signatures of a network generating friction against the constitutive Drive to Endure. The following categories are illustrative, not exhaustive, designed to form the basis of a comparative research program.

- **First-Order Costs:** The direct, material consequences of a network’s conflict with the Drive to Endure. These are the most fundamental indicators, measurable through objective metrics such as excess mortality, morbidity, malnutrition, and other bio-indicators of systemic stress (e.g., via bioarchaeological data from skeletal remains).
- **Systemic Costs (Energetic & Informational):** The resources a system must expend on non-productive internal control rather than on productive capacity or resilience-building. Proxies include the proportion of GDP or total labor allocated to internal security and surveillance (**Energetic Cost**), as well as the costs incurred by actively suppressing corrective feedback, such as censorship laws and innovation lags (**Informational Cost**).

Systemic Costs are, in essence, the energetic price a network must pay to manage the friction that generates its First-Order Costs. These costs are causally interrelated: networks that generate high First-Order Costs (widespread suffering and death) must typically pay high Systemic Costs to manage the resulting dissent. A consistent pattern of high costs across these indicators provides evidence-based, falsifiable grounds for diagnosing low pragmatic viability.

A natural concern is whether these categories can be operationalized in a way that allows for meaningful cross-context comparison. EPC proposes a **layered strategy**. First, within a single society, First-Order and Systemic Costs can be measured in their own currencies (e.g., mortality, GDP allocation to coercion, censorship intensity). Second, across societies, costs can be normalized through comparative ratios, such as the proportion of productive capacity diverted to coercion relative to peers facing similar shocks. Finally, longitudinal analysis can track whether a network’s costs are compounding or declining over time. While no single metric suffices, the triangulation of multiple proxies allows for falsifiable comparative claims. This layered operationalization transforms viability from a metaphor into a measurable, though complex, empirical property.

### **3.4 Methodological Horizons**

EPC’s epistemic posture is that of a philosophical model that generates falsifiable empirical hypotheses, not a scientific research program in itself. Its purpose is to provide a conceptual architecture for interpreting the historical record. As such, its claims are designed to be disciplined by, and find congruence with, findings from fields like cliodynamics and institutional economics (e.g., Tainter 1988; Turchin 2003; Acemoglu & Robinson 2012).

The framework is operationalized through its primary methodological tool: the construction of a **Negative Canon**. This is a robust, Popperian-inspired catalogue of predicates that have been empirically falsified by the historical record of systemic failure. For instance, EPC predicts that a predicate like "slavery is an acceptable organizing principle" will reliably generate immense systemic costs, increasing a network's **normative brittleness**. While a slavery-based empire might endure for a time, EPC hypothesizes it does so with crippling inefficiencies—in surveillance, suppression, and lost innovation—rendering it more likely to shatter under shocks that a more resilient, lower-cost network could survive. The Negative Canon charts such demonstrably failed predicates.

This empirical commitment provides clear falsification conditions. The theory’s core causal engine would be broken if broad historical analysis revealed no statistically significant correlation between a network’s internal friction (its costs) and its long-term viability (its resilience to shocks). If high-friction, coercive systems were consistently found to be no more brittle than low-friction, cooperative ones, the framework would be falsified. While methodologically challenging, this criterion ensures that the model's claims about objectivity remain, in principle, empirically accountable.

## 4. The Architecture of Objectivity: Mapping an Emergent Reality

The EPC model avoids relativism not by positing a transcendent realm of values, but by grounding objectivity in the *necessary existence of a real, mind-independent, and emergent object.* Our moral knowledge is objective insofar as it successfully maps the constraints imposed by this object. This section details the ontological status of this standard—the Apex Network—and the fallible, empirical methodology by which we come to know it, thereby securing a robust, naturalistic realism.

### 4.1 The Apex Network: A Real Object of Inquiry

To defend the Apex Network against the charge of being an unfalsifiable Platonic ideal, we must be precise about its status. The core of the account lies in a crucial distinction: the difference between **the Apex Network as a real, objective standard** and our **epistemic access to it, which is necessarily indirect, fallible, and scientific.** The Apex Network is not fallible; our models of it are.

First, its existence is a structural necessity of the model's premises. Given the constant, system-wide process of pragmatic convergence—where countless individual webs are filtered by a shared reality—the existence of a **maximal, coherent, and shared set of pragmatically successful predicates is a structural necessity.** This emergent historical object—the cumulative, time-tested informational structure forged in the crucible of humanity’s collective, filtered experience—is the real object EPC terms the Apex Network.

One might worry that describing the Apex Network as "cumulative" or "maximal" suggests a hidden teleology, as if history were oriented toward a final moral end-state. EPC explicitly rejects this reading. The Apex Network is not a telos to be reached but a *structural attractor*: the record of design principles that have already demonstrated superior viability under historical constraints. It grows only contingently, through the accretion of successful predicates, and it can shrink when once-viable principles are rendered obsolete by novel pressures. Its objectivity is therefore retrospective and procedural, not teleological: it tracks what has survived, not what must survive. This distinction guards against conflating EPC with Platonic idealism or Whiggish narratives of moral inevitability.

The coherence of EPC's realism rests on a crucial distinction between ontology and epistemology. **Ontologically**, the Apex Network is the mind-independent, emergent object of moral inquiry. It is not a transcendent Platonic Form but is better understood as a complete library of engineering principles discovered through millennia of trial and error—a cumulative, time-tested record of informational "design principles" that have proven resilient against pragmatic selection. This emergent structure functions as the **external truth-maker** for normative claims. A predicate is objectively true not because it aligns with an agent's interests (Railton 1986) or a society's needs (Copp 2007), but because it coheres with this set of maximally viable design principles. The truth-maker is the objective, multi-generational viability of the network's informational code itself, a fact determined by the long-term systemic costs and normative brittleness a predicate generates. **Epistemically**, our access to this object is indirect, empirical, and fallible. Our task is not to intuit a perfect form, but to reverse-engineer its principles by charting the historical wreckage of failed designs. The object is real; our map is provisional.

This framework grounds a robust, fallibilist objectivity by distinguishing between two levels of truth-aptness. This two-level account gives precise meaning to the concept of *contextual truth* without collapsing into relativism:

- A predicate is *contextually true* if it is coherent within a specific, functioning sub-network. "Slavery is acceptable," for example, possessed contextual truth within the dominant network of a slave society, as it cohered with its legal, economic, and social predicates.
- A predicate is *objectively false* if it is incoherent with the real, mind-independent Apex Network. This is an empirical claim about a predicate's long-term pragmatic failure. "Slavery is acceptable" is objectively false because the historical record demonstrates that networks predicated on it reliably generate catastrophic First-Order Costs, ensuring their normative brittleness.

Our objective moral claims are fallible hypotheses about this second level. We claim a predicate is *epistemically justified* for us if it is coherent with our best and most evidence-based *model* of the Apex Network. Moral progress is thus the process of resolving the conflict between unstable contextual truths and objective facts by debugging our societal code.

To summarize the core distinction: **Ontologically,** the Apex Network is the total, cumulative, and trans-historical set of predicates that have proven pragmatically viable. It is a mind-independent object whose structure persists as a causal filter. **Epistemically,** our access to this object is always partial and provisional. Our scientific *model* of the Apex Network is a "snapshot" taken from our current point in history. The objectivity of our claims derives from the reality of the object being mapped; the humility of our project derives from the fact that our map is always incomplete and revisable.

### **4.2 The Methodology: Charting a Real Territory**

Our connection to the Apex Network is purely methodological, grounded in an epistemology that is fundamentally negative and empirical. Our task is not to intuit a perfect society but to reverse-engineer the principles of viable design by studying historical failures. Our task is less like viewing a satellite image of a safe harbor and more like compiling a trans-generational nautical chart from the records of failed voyages. We learn where to sail by meticulously mapping the rocks. This methodology proceeds via two complementary principles.

**1. The Principle of Negative Universalism:** Our most reliable knowledge is of failure. Following Popper (1959), EPC's primary empirical project is to construct an evidence-based **Negative Canon**: a robust, cross-cultural catalogue of predicates that are empirically demonstrated to generate catastrophic First-Order Costs and produce normative brittleness. Predicates like “slavery is acceptable” or “genocide is a valid political tool” belong in this canon. Each failed system is a falsified experiment, providing crucial data for our model.

Crucially, the data signaling these failures is generated most intensely at the points of greatest systemic friction. EPC thus provides a purely pragmatic, non-moralistic justification for the central insight of **standpoint epistemology** (Harding 2004; Code 1991). The testimony of the marginalized is treated as epistemically privileged not as a concession to moral sentiment, but as a diagnostic necessity. Those experiencing the highest First-Order Costs have the most direct and unmediated access to the data signaling a network's impending failure. Their dissent is not noise to be managed; it is the primary signal that a network’s core predicates are misaligned with reality, making their perspective essential for accurately charting the wreckage.

**2. The Test of Independent Convergence:** While the Negative Canon maps the boundaries of failure, we must also identify positive principles of success. To distinguish structural necessity from cultural accident or survivorship bias, this test identifies core functional norms that have emerged independently across networks under maximally different historical and environmental conditions. The recurrent, independent emergence of reciprocity norms, for instance, suggests not mere psychological coincidence but the repeated discovery of game-theoretically stable solutions to universal coordination problems, a finding reinforced by formal models of cooperation (Axelrod 1984). Such convergence provides strong evidence for a predicate's candidacy for the positive core of our model.

### **4.3 The Structure of Objective Knowledge: Core and Periphery**

This methodology does not predict a single, uniquely correct answer for every moral question. Instead, it predicts a structured landscape of objective moral knowledge with two distinct zones: a **Convergent Core** of universally viable predicates and a surrounding **Pluralist Periphery** of multiple, culturally-specific yet workable solutions. The precise boundary between these zones is an ongoing empirical question, not an *a priori* declaration.

The **Convergent Core** consists of predicates that solve universal coordination problems with a narrow, or perhaps unique, range of viable solutions. These are the non-negotiable "engineering principles" for any enduring human society, identified primarily through the Test of Independent Convergence. Norms of reciprocity, for example, likely belong to this core because they represent stable solutions to the Prisoner's Dilemma, a fundamental problem of social life.

The **Pluralist Periphery** accounts for legitimate and persistent cultural disagreements by identifying domains where multiple, equally viable solutions exist. For instance, a well-regulated capitalist system and a robust social democracy represent distinct but demonstrably viable strategies for organizing a complex modern economy. Both have endured for generations without generating the catastrophic First-Order Costs that would place them in the Negative Canon. The ongoing debate between them is not a sign that one must be objectively wrong, but a pragmatic negotiation over which set of second-order costs and benefits a society prefers. This framework allows for deep disagreement without collapsing into relativism, because the entire periphery is still bounded by the hard constraints revealed by the Negative Canon.

This structure provides a powerful tool for adjudicating cultural practices without imposing a single normative model. A predicate like "honor killings are justifiable" can be assessed objectively. The cross-cultural historical and sociological data consistently links this practice to high First-Order Costs (e.g., elevated violence, social fragmentation, demographic instability). It is not a viable option within the Pluralist Periphery; it is a demonstrably failed predicate that belongs in the Negative Canon. The model thus grounds a robust cultural critique not in the superiority of one culture's values, but in the objective, empirical evidence of pragmatic failure.

## **5. Defending the Model: Four Critical Objections**

With the framework's foundations established, this section addresses four of the most pressing objections. The model’s resilience against these challenges strengthens the case for its adoption as a robust naturalistic framework.

### **5.1 Objection: The Stability of Evil**

*Objection:* An oppressive society endures for millennia. Hasn't its network "won" the pragmatic test, thereby making its oppressive predicates objectively true by EPC's standards?

*Reply:* This objection rests on two errors: it mistakes mere endurance for the richer concept of **pragmatic viability**, and it misidentifies the unit of selection.

First, the ‘stable evil’ society is not a coherent network but a system defined by costly conflict between the oppressive network of the dominant and the resistant networks of the subjugated. The predicates of the oppressed are an ineliminable part of the total emergent structure, and their persistent dissent is the primary source of the system's friction.

Second, the objection conflates temporary stability with long-term viability. An oppressive state that persists through immense coercion is not viable; it is a high-cost, inefficient system. Its longevity is not a sign of strength but a measure of the immense energy it must burn to manage its own self-inflicted instability. Such systems are often functionally parasitic, their endurance subsidized by external extraction (e.g., conquest or resource windfalls) that masks their internal normative decay. **Diagnostic Heuristics (present-tense).** A network’s apparent stability is presumptively **parasitic** rather than **viable** when, over a decadal window, (a) internal-control outlays persistently exceed productive public-goods investment; (b) innovation/learning lags widen relative to peers; and (c) dissent-suppression intensity rises with no commensurate reduction in First-Order Costs. These are heuristic thresholds, not moralized ones, and they are intended to enable ex ante risk classification rather than post hoc narrative. Historical analysis reveals that such systems follow predictable decay patterns: escalating coercive costs, information degradation, and institutional brittleness. Their endurance does not make their predicates true; it merely makes them long-running failed experiments whose wreckage we chart to build a better map.

### **5.2 Objection: The Power of Ideology**

*Objection:* Ideology can co-opt the revision process. A network can create "patch" predicates (e.g., “your suffering is a noble trial”) that convince agents to endure failure rather than revise the network's core.

*Reply:* Ideological patches are never pragmatically free. They introduce cascading costs, not only in second-order incoherence but also in the measurable First-Order and Systemic drains of surveillance, propaganda, and enforcement. While ideology can mask the *symptoms* of pragmatic pushback, it cannot eliminate the underlying dysfunction. Crucially, the very need for costly ideological insulation is itself an epistemic red flag. It provides an urgent, present-tense diagnostic criterion: we have a powerful pragmatic reason to be deeply skeptical of any network that requires immense energy expenditure to suppress dissent and explain away suffering. The presence of these defense mechanisms is a primary epistemological signal that the network’s core predicates are misaligned with reality, giving us a reason to heed dissenters *now* as they are the canaries in the coal mine of long-term systemic failure.

### **5.3 Objection: The Grounding Problem Revisited**

*Objection:* The theory is circular. It avoids one metaphysical commitment only to smuggle in another: the ultimate value of endurance. It cannot justify why we ought to care about what survives its pragmatic filter.

*Reply:* This is the most fundamental objection, and the model answers it with a two-level defense that combines a transcendental argument with a conditional, instrumental argument.

First, the transcendental defense: The "Drive to Endure" is not a smuggled normative premise but the transcendental condition for inquiry itself. Its authority is structural, not moral. This move is constitutivist in spirit: it grounds normativity in a condition of possibility for the practice of evaluation (Korsgaard 2009). However, unlike agent-focused constitutivism, EPC's foundation is externalist and system-level. A system that does not persist cannot evaluate, revise, or remember. To engage in normative evaluation is to be part of a system already engaged in the project of enduring. The drive's primacy is not a value we choose, but the constitutive rule of the game we are already playing. To question its primacy is a form of pragmatic self-contradiction, as the act of questioning presupposes the very framework it seeks to deny.

Second, the instrumental defense: Even if one remains unpersuaded by the transcendental argument, the theory's normative force can be framed in a purely conditional and strategic way. The argument breaks down into two parts:

- **The Descriptive Claim:** “Networks organized around predicate X consistently exhibit high systemic costs, leading to a higher probability of collapse under stress.” This is a falsifiable, empirical hypothesis about the world.
- **The Strategic Recommendation:** “*If* a system’s goal is, as a matter of fact, to persist through time, *then* it has a powerful pragmatic reason to avoid predicate X.”

The “ought” at stake here is **strategic rather than categorical**. EPC does not command commitment from the outside; it maps the consequences for systems that adopt certain predicates versus those that do not. Its normative force arises through **internal critique**, supplying a standard of rationality immanent to the ongoing project of any society that seeks to endure. In this sense, the transcendental argument secures the philosophical grounding of the system as such, while the instrumental argument provides a pragmatic, non-question-begging method for its application. Formally, the “ought” in this framework has **wide scope**: if the goal is to endure, then one ought to revise away from predicates that undermine resilience. This makes clear that EPC does not derive a categorical “ought” from descriptive premises, but a conditional imperative embedded in the very logic of survival.

### **5.4 Objection: The Inaccessibility of the Apex Network**

*Objection:* The Apex Network is epistemologically problematic. As a real, mind-independent standard that is fundamentally inaccessible, it is functionally equivalent to an unknowable Platonic Form. An unknowable standard is no standard at all.

*Reply:* This objection correctly identifies the epistemological challenge but conflates our partial access with total inaccessibility. As argued in Section 4.1, the Apex Network is a real, emergent historical object whose existence is a structural consequence of the model's premises. The challenge is purely epistemological. Our access is partial and fallible, but this is the standard condition for inquiry into any large-scale emergent system, from an ecosystem to the global economy. The existence of this real object is what grounds the possibility of making objective, truth-apt claims. Our epistemic humility comes from acknowledging that our map is always provisional. Our confidence, however, comes from the fact that we are mapping a real territory. Our claim to objectivity rests not on a perfect vision of the safe harbor, but on the undeniable reality of the historical wreckage charted in our Negative Canon.

### 5.5 Objection: The Asymmetry of Testing

*Objection:* The test for an empirical claim (“water boils at 100°C”) is immediate and decisive, while the test for a moral claim (“slavery is unacceptable”) is slow, diffuse, and unfolds over generations. This asymmetry is so great that it renders the claim of a unified evolutionary test meaningless.

*Reply:* This observed asymmetry is not a flaw in the model but a direct prediction of it. EPC posits a unified filter—pragmatic selection—while acknowledging that the complexity of the system being tested determines the timescale and texture of the feedback. A simple physical system yields rapid feedback loops. A complex adaptive social system, by its very nature, yields slow, distributed, and holistic signals. The difference in velocity does not imply a difference in kind for the ultimate arbiter (reality's feedback). This asymmetry explains precisely why moral knowledge is so much harder-won than simple empirical knowledge, without undermining the claim that both are ultimately adjudicated in the same objective, pragmatic court.

## **6. Situating the Model in the Metaethical Landscape**

EPC occupies a unique position, and clarifying its relation to existing literature strengthens its claim to novelty.

### **6.1 A Form of Procedural, Pragmatic Realism**

EPC is a form of procedural, pragmatic realism. It is realist in positing objective, mind-independent truths about the viability of normative systems. Unlike Non-Natural Realism, however, it grounds these truths not in mysterious, *sui generis* moral properties, but in the observable, empirical facts about which network structures prove most efficient at satisfying the constitutive Drive to Endure. The model's central realist commitment lies in a crucial distinction: while 'truth' is a property internal to a network's coherence, viability is an objective, external, and relational property of that network’s interaction with reality. The truth-makers for moral claims are therefore the objective facts about which informational structures generate lower systemic costs and greater resilience against the selective pressures of the real world.

This stance provides a robust, naturalistic explanation for the realist-sounding grammar of our moral discourse. Where quasi-realism (Blackburn 1993) ingeniously seeks to vindicate this grammar without realist commitments, EPC argues that the grammar is sound because it is, in fact, tracking an objective procedural reality. This procedural approach can be sharpened by contrasting it with semantic projects that seek to vindicate realism at the level of grammar, such as Bart Streumer's defense of "quasi-quasi-realism." Where such views ground the truth of a normative judgment in facts about an assessor's attitudes, EPC provides an external, empirical truth-maker. The objective falsehood of "slavery is acceptable" is grounded not in any agent's disapproval, but in the mind-independent, historical fact of the catastrophic systemic costs that networks predicated on it reliably generate. Thus, while quasi-realist and expressivist projects (e.g., Gibbard 1990) brilliantly explain the logic of our moral language by grounding it in attitudes or practices, EPC advances beyond them by providing these external, empirical truth-makers, rendering moral discourse not just projectively coherent but procedurally referential to a mind-independent landscape of pragmatic viability.

Finally, EPC's fully externalist and historical methodology distinguishes it from other naturalist realisms and proceduralisms. Cornell Realists, for instance, typically ground moral facts in agent-centric properties, such as an individual's "objective interests" (Railton 1986) or a synchronic "homeostatic property cluster" of human goods (Boyd 1988). For EPC, these individual-level facts are secondary. The primary object of evaluation is not the interests of an agent but the multi-generational viability of the network's informational code itself. The objective interests of a tyrant like Caligula are irrelevant to the assessment; the socio-political network that licensed his predicates was an objective, evolutionary failure because of the systemic friction and normative brittleness it generated. Similarly, EPC's proceduralism diverges from other pragmatic naturalisms (Kitcher 2011) or constructivisms (Lenman 2007) by eschewing reliance on idealized rational procedures or hypothetical agreements. Instead, it grounds normativity in the actual, messy, historical dynamics of network selection, offering a fully empirical criterion that treats moral facts as discoverable, emergent features of real-world social systems.

### **6.2 A Completion of the Quinean Project**

EPC completes the Quinean project by extending its holism to dissolve the final dichotomy: fact/value. Where Quine described the static architecture of an individual's web, EPC supplies the missing piece: the **dynamic, evolutionary engine** of pragmatic selection that operates on entire networks. It fulfills Dewey's (1929) project of a naturalized, experimental ethics and argues that the solidarity Rorty (1989) champions is not a contingent starting point but an emergent property of objectively successful, low-friction networks.

### **6.3 An Externalist Alternative to Naturalist Rivals**

EPC's systems-level externalism distinguishes it from other influential naturalisms.

- **vs. Neo-Aristotelianism (Foot 2001):** The primary unit of selection is the **informational network**, not the flourishing of the individual organism. The metric is the thin, procedural standard of viability, not a thick, teleological concept of "human goodness." This allows EPC to robustly account for the Pluralist Periphery where multiple forms of life may prove viable.
- **vs. Railton and Boyd's Realism:** For EPC, the primary object of evaluation is not an individual's "objective interests" (Railton) or a synchronic "homeostatic property cluster" (Boyd), but the **multi-generational viability of the informational code itself**. The objective interests of a tyrant like Caligula are irrelevant; the network that licensed Caligula's predicates was an objective, evolutionary failure because of the systemic friction it generated—a fact independent of anyone's interests or attitudes.
- **vs. Moral Progress Literature (Buchanan & Powell 2018):** EPC provides a specific, **non-teleological mechanism for moral progress**, distinct from accounts that might posit an inherent directionality. Progress in EPC is a process of "debugging" driven by the eliminative pressure of the Drive to Endure—a purely backward-looking process of charting failures, not a forward-looking process aimed at a final goal.
- **vs. Error Theory (Mackie, Joyce):** Where error theory argues that moral claims are systematically false because they presuppose the existence of "queer," non-natural properties, EPC offers a naturalistic reinterpretation of their truth-makers. It agrees that moral properties are not non-natural, but it denies that this entails falsehood. Instead, it posits that our moral discourse has been successfully, if imperfectly, tracking objective, procedural facts about the viability of social arrangements all along. Moral "wrongness," on this view, is not a queer property but a relational, empirical property of a predicate that reliably generates systemic costs and normative brittleness. EPC thus aims to naturalize the reference of moral terms, not eliminate them.
- **vs. Street's Darwinian Dilemma (Street 2006):** Where Street argues that evolutionary explanations undermine realist accounts by rendering moral truths too coincidentally aligned with adaptive beliefs, EPC resolves the dilemma by treating moral truths as emergent products of the same evolutionary process. Adaptive viability is not a coincidence but the truth-maker itself: predicates that enhance pragmatic endurance are objectively true precisely because they track the real constraints of the Apex Network, transforming evolutionary pressure from a debunker into a grounder of objectivity.

| View | Truth-makers | Unit of Evaluation | Method | Objectivity |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| EPC | External viability facts (low cost, high resilience) | Informational network | Comparative, failure-driven empirics | Procedural, fallibilist, externalist |
| Quasi-realism | Attitude-dependent projection | Attitudes/practices | Semantic explanation | Deflated, grammar-vindicating |
| Cornell Realism | Natural properties of human good | Agent interests | Reflective equilibrium + science | Robust, agent-centered |
| Neo-Aristotelian | Flourishing of organism | Life-form | Teleological evaluation | Robust, teleological |
| Constructivism | Idealized procedures | Rational agents | Hypothetical agreement | Procedural, internalist |

### 6.4 The Dynamics of Moral Innovation

Finally, EPC's framework privileges neither tradition nor novelty, but demonstrated functionality. An established norm has no special authority beyond its track record of viability. A moral innovation, such as the predicate 'slavery is wrong' in the 18th century, faces the same test. It succeeded not because of sentiment, but because it proposed a solution to the immense and growing First-Order costs the incumbent network was generating. The model's bias is not toward the old, but toward what works. Revolutionary moral insights that demonstrably reduce systemic friction will, by definition, propagate and become candidates for the Apex Network. This is not teleology: EPC makes no claim that history trends toward an ideal; it merely tracks which designs have, so far, resisted failure under widening classes of constraint.

## **7. Conclusion: Inquiry as a Pragmatic Project**

Emergent Pragmatic Coherentism (EPC) contends that morality is not a given but a project. It offers a unified theory of inquiry—scientific, political, and ethical—as facets of the same fundamental human endeavor: the multi-generational effort to construct the most viable maps for navigating our shared existence. On this account, an "is" is a predicate about how the world functions, while an "ought" is a time-tested predicate about how best to act within it. Both are adjudicated in the same ultimate court of pragmatic selection, governed by the constitutive Drive to Endure.

EPC is more than a diagnostic framework for internal normative disputes; it provides a foundational account of normative authority itself. It allows us to be both humble and hopeful. We are humble in recognizing that our current maps of the Apex Network are necessarily imperfect and fallible. Yet we are hopeful, because moral progress is real, observable, and grounded in an objective standard. The abolition of slavery, for example, represents not a mere shift in opinion but a profound act of debugging our societal code. This is not to suggest such progress was inevitable, but to frame it as an objective, fallible discovery: the hard-won removal of a predicate for our Negative Canon, aligning our shared network more closely with the real, mind-independent structure of viability.

Progress occurs when we treat suffering, dissent, and instability not as mere political problems to be managed but as primary epistemological data. They are the “check engine” lights of society, signaling misalignments between networks of predicates and the constraints of reality.

The authority of an “ought” is therefore not grounded in a mysterious metaphysical foundation or in the structure of rational agency alone. It lies instead in the immense, objective, and procedural weight of the evidence generated by humanity’s long and often brutal encounter with reality. An “ought,” on this view, is a predicate coherent with our most pragmatically resilient networks—a hard-won empirical signal that it aligns with a viable strategy for the shared, enduring project of human cooperation.

This diagnosis extends beyond ethics. EPC reframes epistemology itself as a pragmatic enterprise: dissent, anomaly, and instability are not obstacles to be eliminated but the very data by which inquiry advances. In this respect, EPC completes Quine’s holism, naturalizing not only science but also ethics, and dissolving the last vestige of the fact/value divide. Moral philosophy, on this view, is no longer the search for ultimate *a priori* justifications but the fallible, empirical craft of discovering principles of viable design by charting the wreckage of humanity’s past failures. In this way, the project of making a better world and the project of making a better map converge into one.

### **Glossary**

- **Apex Network:** The objective, mind-independent standard in EPC, representing the complete, trans-historical set of design principles for a maximally resilient and efficient human society. Crucially, this real object must be distinguished from our scientific *model* of it, which is the fallible map we construct from the historical evidence available to date.
- **Convergent Core:** Predicate set supported by independent convergence across heterogeneous contexts and exhibiting superior viability across representative shocks.
- **Drive to Endure:** The minimal, constitutive precondition for a system's persistence over time, understood as the transmission of its informational structure. It functions not as a chosen value but as the **transcendental filter** imposed by reality, which any system of inquiry necessarily presupposes.
- **First-Order Costs:** The direct, material consequences of a network's conflict with the **Drive to Endure** (e.g., excess mortality, systemic violence, resource depletion). They are the primary, objective data signaling low pragmatic viability.
- **Negative Canon:** An evidence-based catalogue of predicates empirically demonstrated across diverse historical contexts to generate catastrophic **First-Order Costs** and induce **normative brittleness** (e.g., “slavery is acceptable”).
- **Normative Brittleness:** A network's inherent vulnerability to external shocks. It is a direct consequence of high **Systemic Costs**, as the immense energy spent on internal control diverts resources from adaptation and innovation. It is the functional inverse of resilience.
- **Pluralist Periphery:** Predicate families for which multiple alternatives achieve comparable within a pre-specified tolerance band under matched shocks (equifinality).
- **Pragmatic Pushback:** The experiential feedback from reality when a predicate misaligns with physical or social constraints. At the individual level, it is experienced as dysfunction; its aggregation across a population generates the **Systemic Costs** that drive network selection.
- **Pragmatic Viability:** A system's **homeostatic efficiency**; its ability to propagate its informational structure with low internal friction and minimal energy expenditure on coercion. It is the primary metric for evolutionary pragmatic selection, and is distinct from **mere endurance**, which may be achieved through high-cost, brittle means.
- **Shared Network (of Predicates):** The public, structural unit of shared knowledge. It emerges bottom-up when the **Webs of Belief** of multiple agents are forced to converge on a common set of predicates as a result of facing shared **pragmatic pushback**.
- **Systemic Costs:** The secondary, non-productive costs a network must pay to manage the friction that generates its **First-Order Costs**. These include the energetic and informational resources expended on internal control, such as coercion, surveillance, and ideological maintenance.
- **Web of Belief (or Individual Network):** The Quinean concept for an individual agent’s coherent, holistic system of beliefs. In EPC, this is the fundamental, psychological unit of knowledge, which is shaped by **pragmatic pushback**.
