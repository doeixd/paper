# **Extending Quine's Web: A Procedural and Naturalistic Model of Moral Objectivity**

## **Abstract**

The is/ought problem, this paper contends, is not a metaphysical chasm but a conceptual artifact of foundationalist epistemology. To reframe this enduring challenge, this paper develops **Emergent Pragmatic Coherentism (EPC)**, a descriptive, systems-level model of moral knowledge. Building upon Quinean holism, EPC models knowledge as an emergent hierarchy of shared “networks of predicates.” Within this architecture, truth is treated deflationarily as a functional label for robust coherence within a pragmatically-tested network. This network-relativity is disciplined by an external, physical filter—evolutionary pragmatic selection. The ultimate metric for a network is not mere persistence but **pragmatic viability**: a system's homeostatic efficiency in propagating its informational structure with minimal coercive and energetic cost. Networks that generate high systemic costs exhibit **normative brittleness**, a condition that increases their probability of collapse when faced with external shocks. This process grounds a form of procedural objectivity: while truth-claims are internal to a network, networks themselves can be objectively ranked by their long-term viability. The ultimate regulative standard, the Apex Network, is not a Platonic ideal but a fallible scientific model of a real, mind-independent object: the aggregate historical record of causal outcomes. EPC’s central claim is conditional: *if* one begins from a minimal naturalism where endurance is a non-negotiable physical constraint for any information-bearing system, *then* EPC provides a robust, falsifiable account of moral progress. It locates normative authority not in metaphysical fiat, but in the empirical lessons encoded in humanity’s most resilient social and epistemic structures.

## **1. Introduction: Reframing the Is/ought Problem**

The perceived gap between claims of fact (“is”) and claims of value (“ought”) has long been treated as a fundamental chasm in our conceptual landscape. This paper argues that the problem is a symptom of a foundationalist epistemology that artificially segregates descriptive and normative claims into distinct magisteria. The solution proposed here is not to construct another speculative bridge between them, but rather to adopt an epistemology where no such gap arises—a unified system that adjudicates all claims in the same **evolutionary court of pragmatic selection**.

This paper defends such a framework: **Emergent Pragmatic Coherentism (EPC)**. At its core, EPC is a systematic extrapolation of Quinean holism. It begins with the premise that individuals navigate reality using a fallible “web of belief” (Quine 1951). Because all agents face shared physical and social constraints, their individual webs are necessarily forced to overlap, giving rise to an emergent hierarchy of shared “networks of predicates.” Within this model, a claim is 'true' in a deflationary sense if it is coherent within a given network. This initial network-relativity is then disciplined by an external physical filter, grounding a form of procedural objectivity. Networks that generate high degrees of systemic friction prove less viable and are selected against over time, allowing for an objective ranking of networks based on their long-term pragmatic success.

The ambition of this project is not to solve the ultimate grounding problem of metaethics, but to take a descriptive and conditional turn. Its central claim is this: **if one begins from a minimal naturalism where endurance is a de facto physical constraint on any information-bearing system, *then* EPC provides a robust, falsifiable model of procedural objectivity and moral progress.** This framing is a methodological choice. By bracketing the question "Why value survival?", EPC avoids metaphysical regress and instead models the actual process by which our normative claims are tested, revised, and sometimes discarded. Its payoff is not a final answer to metaethical skepticism, but a powerful diagnostic toolkit and a sociological-cum-epistemological research program for understanding normative change.

The argument proceeds in five stages. It first details the emergence of shared networks (Section 2), then defines the evolutionary engine of pragmatic viability and its rigorous methodology (Section 3). It then refines the concept of the Apex Network and the structure of objective knowledge it entails (Section 4). With the model fully articulated, it is defended against several deep-seated philosophical objections (Section 5) and finally situated within the landscape of contemporary naturalistic metaethics (Section 6).

## **2. The Architecture of Emergence: From Webs to Networks**

EPC extends Quinean holism from an individual, psychological model to a social epistemology. The model rests on two premises: (1) Every agent navigates the world using their own web of beliefs; (2) Every agent is subject to the pragmatic constraints of a shared physical and social reality.

From these, a third fact follows: wherever agents successfully coordinate their actions, their individual webs are forced to overlap. This intersection is not a top-down imposition but an automatic, bottom-up emergence. When two people successfully build a canoe, their individual beliefs about buoyancy, material stress, and hydrodynamics must converge through trial and error, producing a shared, functional network of interlocking claims. This process of convergence scales to all levels of social organization, from family units to scientific communities and nation-states.

To analyze this phenomenon, EPC shifts from the psychological "web of belief" to the public, structural concept of a **“network of predicates.”** A predicate is the logical structure of a claim (e.g., “…is wrong,” “…boils at 100°C,” “…is a universal human right”). This conceptual move is crucial for three reasons: first, it shifts the unit of analysis from the private and subjective to the shared and public. Second, it makes the formal commensurability of factual and normative claims explicit; both are predicates that must cohere within a larger system. Third, it operationalizes a deflationary account of truth. 'Truth' is treated as a functional label signifying a predicate's robust coherence within a specified network. Thus, a predicate is 'true' *relative to* a network, a context-sensitive dynamism that serves as the foundation for EPC’s account of procedural objectivity.

## **3. The Engine of Selection: Pragmatic Viability and Its Costs**

What prevents emergent networks from being arbitrary, relativistic constructs is the relentless filter of evolutionary pragmatic selection. This section refines this mechanism to address concerns about circularity and to establish a rigorous methodology.

### **3.1 Endurance as a Physical Filter, Not a Normative Goal**

The model is anchored not by a normative "drive to endure," but by **endurance as a non-negotiable physical filter.** A network of predicates is an informational structure. For this information to propagate through time, it requires a physical substrate (a society of agents and their institutions). The filter of endurance is not a value we choose; it is a constitutive constraint on any system existing in time, analogous to gravity. An architect need not personally *value* gravity, but any design that ignores its constraints is not a viable alternative—it is simply a failure.

This framing sidesteps the Ship of Theseus problem regarding a system’s identity over time. EPC does not normatively privilege the persistence of a "formal structure" over its "substantive values." The unit of selection is the **informational code of the network itself**. The sole criterion is whether that code successfully propagates. A network that jettisons its core values to survive has failed to propagate its code; conversely, a network whose institutions collapse but whose code is preserved (e.g., in texts, like Roman law) may yet be re-instantiated. The filter is agnostic; it simply eliminates informational systems that fail to secure their own transmission.

### **3.2 Pragmatic Viability: Homeostatic Efficiency vs. Mere Persistence**

The selective criterion is not mere endurance but **pragmatic viability**. This is a measure of a system's **homeostatic efficiency**: its ability to maintain stability and propagate its informational structure with minimal energetic and coercive cost. A system that persists for millennia by burning immense energy to suppress internal dissent is *enduring* but not *viable*. It is a high-cost, inefficient system whose stability masks a profound **normative brittleness**—an inherent vulnerability to external shocks like famine, technological disruption, or invasion.

High-coercion systems are energetically inefficient and informationally fragile. Suppressing dissent requires vast resource expenditure and simultaneously blinds the network to the primary data stream signaling its own flaws and misalignments with reality. This distinction grounds the model’s defense against the charge of "might makes right" in a descriptive claim about systemic efficiency, not in a pre-committed normative claim about the evils of coercion.

### **3.3 A Refined Hierarchy of Systemic Costs**

To operationalize "viability," EPC specifies a causal hierarchy of systemic costs, which function as commensurable indicators of a network's inefficiency.

*   **Biological Costs:** The most fundamental indicators of friction with physical reality. These are measurable through objective metrics like excess mortality, morbidity, malnutrition, and other bio-indicators of systemic stress (e.g., via bioarchaeological data).
*   **Energetic Costs:** The resources a system must expend on non-productive internal control rather than productive capacity. Proxies include the proportion of GDP dedicated to internal security, surveillance, and penal systems, as well as the depletion rates of key natural and social resources (like social trust).
*   **Informational Costs:** The costs incurred by actively suppressing corrective feedback. These can be measured via indicators such as censorship laws, political prisoner counts, low social trust metrics, and innovation lags in sectors where free inquiry is suppressed (e.g., the Soviet suppression of genetics).

These costs are theoretically interrelated: networks that generate high Biological Costs (widespread suffering) must typically pay high Energetic and Informational Costs to manage the resulting dissent. A consistent pattern of high costs across these indicators provides evidence-based grounds for diagnosing low pragmatic viability.

### **3.4 A More Robust Historical Methodology**

Addressing the charge that its historical methodology is underdeveloped requires a more sophisticated, falsifiable approach.

1.  **Addressing Causal Complexity and the Slavery Case:** EPC does not claim a single predicate *causes* a society's collapse. Rather, it generates a testable hypothesis: predicates like "slavery is an acceptable organizing principle" reliably introduce significant systemic burdens (high Biological, Energetic, and Informational Costs) that increase a network's **normative brittleness**. A critic might argue that slavery-based empires were highly successful due to the energetic surplus they provided. EPC's response is that this view overlooks the immense *net* costs: the vast resources required for surveillance and suppression, the constant threat of revolt, the stifling of innovation among the enslaved population, and the creation of a rigid social structure resistant to adaptation. A brittle network is more likely to shatter under external shocks (famine, plague, invasion) that a more resilient, lower-cost network might survive. The shock is the proximate cause of collapse; the predicate is the underlying vulnerability.
2.  **Methodological Tools:** The research program for EPC must employ tools from comparative historical analysis, cliodynamics, and institutional economics (Tainter 1988; Turchin 2003). The method involves identifying **Historical Paired Cases**: societies with differing normative structures that faced similar external shocks. EPC predicts a statistically significant pattern: lower-friction networks will demonstrate a higher probability of adapting and surviving such shocks. This provides a probabilistic, not deterministic, theory of systemic risk.
3.  **Confronting Selection Bias:** Historical records are undeniably biased towards survivors. EPC confronts this by adopting a Popperian, falsificationist orientation. The primary goal is not to prove which systems "succeed" from a biased sample, but to build a robust **Negative Canon**: a catalogue of predicates empirically demonstrated to generate catastrophic costs and normative brittleness across multiple, independent contexts. Studying systemic failure is an investigative strategy less susceptible to survivorship bias.

## **4. The Architecture of Objectivity: A Falsifiable Model**

EPC avoids relativism by grounding objectivity in a rigorous, fallible, and empirical methodology centered on the concept of the Apex Network.

### **4.1 The Apex Network: A Scientific Model of the Historical Record**

The Apex Network is perhaps the model's most contested concept. To defend it against the charge of being an unfalsifiable Platonic ideal, its status must be precisely clarified. It is best understood as **a fallible scientific model of a real, mind-independent object.**

*   **The Real Object:** The object is not a metaphysical Form. It is the **aggregate historical record of causal outcomes**—the sum total of "what happened when human societies were organized around predicate X." This vast dataset of systemic successes and failures constitutes a mind-independent, structural fact about our world, analogous to the Earth's climate system or its fossil record. It is complex and can only be accessed through interpretation, but it is not a mere social construct.
*   **The Scientific Model:** Our *Apex Network* is our best-efforts, scientific model of this real historical object. The relationship between the Apex Network model and the real record of outcomes is analogous to the relationship between a General Circulation Model and the Earth's actual climate. The model is judged not by its finality, but by its **predictive and explanatory power**.

Crucially, this structure ensures the project is empirical. The Apex Network model generates **falsifiable, probabilistic predictions about systemic risk.** For example, a model informed by the consistent failure of totalitarian systems predicts that a new political arrangement reliant on total information control will exhibit high systemic costs and be highly vulnerable to collapse. If historical or future events contradict this—if such a system proves highly efficient, adaptive, and resilient over long durations—then our model is **falsified** and must be revised. A predicate is **epistemically justified** if it is coherent with our current, best-tested model of the Apex Network. It is **objectively true** if it is coherent with the real, causal patterns in the historical record that our model attempts to represent.

### **4.2 The Structure of Moral Knowledge: Core and Periphery**

This methodology predicts a structured landscape of moral knowledge, resolving the concern that EPC’s account of pluralism is undertheorized. The boundary between settled moral facts and legitimate disagreement becomes an empirical question guided by clear criteria.

*   **The Convergent Core:** This comprises predicates whose violation has been empirically demonstrated, across diverse contexts, to reliably generate **catastrophic First-Order Costs**, leading to systemic collapse or severe normative brittleness. These are often solutions to non-negotiable, universal coordination problems. Examples include norms of reciprocity (whose widespread absence invites collective action failure), prohibitions on murder (whose absence makes stable society impossible), and incest taboos (whose violation incurs devastating biological costs). These predicates form the foundation of the Negative Canon.
*   **The Pluralist Periphery:** This encompasses domains where multiple, culturally specific solutions can exist, none of which appear to incur catastrophic First-Order Costs. Disagreements in this periphery are legitimate and often represent negotiations over competing **Second-Order Costs** (e.g., different but relatively stable models of political economy that make different trade-offs between values like individual liberty and social equality).

This framework allows for deep, persistent disagreement without collapsing into relativism, because the entire range of viable options in the periphery is bounded by the hard constraints revealed by the Negative Canon at the core.

## **5. Defending the Model: Deeper Objections**

With the framework now strengthened, this section addresses several critical objections.

### **5.1 Objection: The Stability of Evil and the Ideological Trap**

*Objection:* An oppressive society like North Korea has endured for over 70 years. Doesn't this prove that high-coercion, ideologically rigid systems can be viable, contradicting EPC's central claim?

*Reply:* This objection conflates endurance with viability. The EPC framework explains such cases not as counterexamples, but as systems caught in a **homeostatic trap**. A critic might point to North Korea's longevity as proof of its viability, but EPC predicts precisely this kind of pathological stability. Its endurance has been achieved at the cost of catastrophic Biological Costs (recurrent famine), extreme Energetic Costs (a hyper-militarized economy), and total Informational Costs (absolute suppression of feedback). It "endures" by radically lowering its metabolic rate, becoming parasitic on external inputs and its own dwindling resource base, and exhibiting extreme normative brittleness. Its stability is a sign of profound systemic pathology, not health. The claim that ideological "patches" are cost-free is false; the costs are simply paid in the currency of resilience and adaptability. Such systems are long-running failed experiments, confirming EPC's predictions about the significant price of predicates misaligned with reality.

### **5.2 Objection: The Grounding Problem Revisited**

*Objection:* The theory remains circular. It avoids one metaphysical commitment only to smuggle in another: the ultimate value of endurance.

*Reply:* The refined model answers this by being systematically consistent with its descriptive and conditional turn. The authority of endurance is **physical, not moral**. EPC does not make a categorical normative claim, but a strategic, instrumental one. The argument can be broken down into two parts:

*   **The Descriptive Claim:** “Networks organized around predicate X consistently exhibit high systemic costs, leading to a higher probability of collapse under stress.” This is a falsifiable, empirical hypothesis about the world.
*   **The Strategic Recommendation:** “*If* a system’s goal is, as a matter of fact, to persist through time, *then* it has a powerful pragmatic reason to avoid predicate X.”

The "ought" here is strategic and instrumental, not categorical. The model does not tell us we *must* value survival. It provides a diagnostic tool for identifying the structural principles that lead to collapse for any system that *does* operate under that de facto physical constraint. Its normative force is that of **internal critique**: it provides a standard of rationality internal to the ongoing project of any enduring society.

## **6. Situating the Model in the Metaethical Landscape**

EPC occupies a unique position, and clarifying its relation to existing literature strengthens its claim to novelty.

### **6.1 A Form of Procedural, Pragmatic Realism**

EPC can be classified as a form of moral realism, but its truth-makers are unconventional. It is realist in positing objective truths about the viability of normative systems. These truths are not grounded in mysterious non-natural properties but in observable, empirical facts about which network structures prove most efficient at self-propagation. While 'truth' is a property internal to a network, **viability** is an objective, external property of that network's relationship with reality. This framework offers a naturalistic grounding for the realist-sounding grammar of moral discourse that quasi-realism (Blackburn 1993) seeks to vindicate without positing moral properties as such.

### **6.2 A Completion of the Quinean Project**

EPC extends Quine’s holism to dissolve the fact/value distinction, identifying a missing piece in his framework: a **dynamic, evolutionary engine** of pragmatic selection that operates on whole networks. In doing so, it fulfills Dewey's (1929) project of a naturalized, experimental ethics and argues that the solidarity Rorty (1989) champions is not a contingent starting point but an emergent property of objectively successful, low-friction networks.

### **6.3 An Externalist Alternative to Naturalist Rivals**

EPC's systems-level externalism distinguishes it from other influential naturalisms.

*   **vs. Neo-Aristotelianism (Foot 2001):** For EPC, the primary unit of selection is the **informational network**, not the flourishing of the individual organism. The metric is the thin, procedural standard of viability, not a thick, teleological concept of "human goodness." This allows EPC to robustly account for the Pluralist Periphery where multiple forms of life may prove viable.
*   **vs. Railton and Boyd's Realism:** Peter Railton grounds moral goodness in what would satisfy an agent's "objective interests," while Richard Boyd defines it as a "homeostatic property cluster." Both are powerful naturalist accounts, but EPC differs fundamentally in its unit of selection and its time scale. For EPC, the primary object of evaluation is not an individual's interests or a synchronic cluster of properties, but the **multi-generational viability of the informational code itself**. The objective interests of a tyrant like Caligula are irrelevant; the network that licensed Caligula's predicates was an objective, evolutionary failure because of the systemic friction it generated, a fact independent of anyone's interests or attitudes (Street 2006).
*   **vs. Moral Progress Literature:** EPC contributes to the work of thinkers like Buchanan & Powell (2018) by providing a specific, non-teleological mechanism for moral progress: a process of social-epistemic "debugging" driven by the elimination of predicates that generate high First-Order Costs and are thus added to the Negative Canon.

## **7. Conclusion: Inquiry as a Pragmatic Research Program**

Emergent Pragmatic Coherentism reframes morality as a project of collective inquiry, not a discovery of pre-existing truths. It treats all claims as part of a multi-generational effort to construct more viable maps for navigating a complex reality. An "is" is a predicate about how the world appears to function; an "ought" is a time-tested predicate about how best to act within it. Both are ultimately adjudicated by the same process of long-term pragmatic selection.

This framework is a theory of **internal normative diagnostics**. It provides a method for a system to debug its own organizing principles by attending to empirical feedback. It allows us to be both epistemically humble, knowing our current maps are fallible, and cautiously optimistic, because moral progress can be understood as a real, observable phenomenon. From this perspective, the abolition of slavery was not a mere change of opinion; it was a profound act of **debugging our societal code**—identifying and removing a demonstrably failed organizing principle that reliably generated catastrophic systemic costs.

Progress occurs when we treat suffering and dissent not merely as political problems to be managed, but as **primary epistemological data**. They are the "check engine" light for a society, signaling a misalignment between its network of predicates and the constraints of reality. The authority of a moral “ought” is thus found not in a transcendent foundation, but in the immense, procedural weight of accumulated historical evidence. EPC reframes the task of moral philosophy: from a search for ultimate justification to the ongoing, fallible craft of charting the wreckage of humanity's past failures in order to better navigate the future.
