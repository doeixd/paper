# **Procedural Realism: A Pragmatic and Naturalistic Account of Moral Objectivity**

## **Abstract**

This paper confronts the long-standing metaethical impasse over moral objectivity, arguing that challenges from the is/ought problem, error theory, and evolutionary debunking stem from a flawed, static epistemology. We deploy a dynamic, naturalistic framework that reframes moral inquiry as a form of empirical cartography: the project of mapping a real, mind-independent "landscape of viability" shaped by pragmatic constraints.

Our methodology is the **Pragmatic Test**, a falsifiable research program that assesses a normative system’s viability by measuring its real-world systemic costs and latent fragilities. Its primary tool is the construction of a **Negative Canon**—an evidence-based catalogue of "failed normative designs" that have been historically falsified by their own unsustainable costs, effectively charting the impassable terrain of the moral landscape.

This model provides a non-teleological account of moral progress as the process of debugging our societal maps. It grounds objectivity in observable, procedural facts about which designs prove most resilient, thereby naturalizing the referent of moral terms to answer error theory and transforming evolutionary pressures from a debunker into the very engine of objectivity. The result is a form of **procedural realism** that reframes ethics as a diagnostic science—a form of systemic moral risk assessment.

## **1. Introduction: Charting the Moral Landscape**

For centuries, a chasm has divided our knowledge: the gap between the world of facts ("is") and the world of values ("ought"). This apparent division is more than a philosopher's puzzle; it is an intellectual crisis that has pushed metaethics into an intractable stalemate. Moral realists defend the objectivity of values, but often at the cost of invoking mysterious, non-natural properties. In response, a host of anti-realist positions reduce our deepest normative commitments to mere emotion, preference, or collective delusion. This paper argues that the impasse is not a feature of a divided reality, but a conceptual artifact of a flawed and static epistemology—a cartographical error that arises when we use the wrong tools to chart the territory.

The solution requires a new set of diagnostic tools, established in a companion paper, "The Architecture of Inquiry." That work modeled knowledge as a dynamic, evolving "Network of Predicates"—a fallible public map for navigating an objective landscape of pragmatic constraints. It detailed how such networks are tested against the real-world consequences of their claims. This paper deploys that engine to complete its most critical task: to show how moral inquiry can be understood as a rigorous, empirical project of mapping a real, mind-independent "landscape of viability."

Our thesis is that moral objectivity can be naturalized as a form of **procedural realism**. On this view, moral truths are not mysterious properties but mind-independent, procedural facts about which principles of social organization prove resilient and sustainable under real-world selective pressures. An "ought" is not a different kind of fact, but a hard-won discovery about this landscape—a design principle that has been empirically confirmed to be a viable route on our collective map.

The primary tool for this cartographical project is the **Pragmatic Test**, a falsifiable research program that assesses a normative system’s viability by measuring its systemic costs and latent fragilities. Its chief methodology is the construction of a **Negative Canon**—an evidence-based catalogue of "failed normative designs" that have been historically falsified by their own unsustainable costs, effectively charting the impassable terrain of the moral landscape.

This framework has significant metaethical payoffs. It provides a naturalistic referent for our moral terms, offering a direct answer to error theory's charge that our moral discourse fails to describe reality. By grounding objectivity in the very process of pragmatic selection, it transforms evolutionary pressures from a debunker of morality into the very engine of its objectivity. The argument will proceed as follows. Section 2 will situate this procedural realism within the contemporary metaethical landscape. Section 3 will detail the methodology of the Pragmatic Test and its diagnostic toolkit. Section 4 will develop our account of moral objectivity and progress as the process of debugging our societal maps to better align with this landscape of viability. Finally, Section 5 will defend the model against core objections, demonstrating its power as a robust, naturalistic alternative in ethics.

## **2. The Metaethical Impasse and a Procedural Alternative**

To ground a naturalistic moral objectivity, any theory must navigate a landscape of formidable challenges. On one side stands J. L. Mackie’s error theory, which argues that our moral claims are systematically false because they presuppose the existence of metaphysically "queer," non-natural properties. On another, quasi-realists like Simon Blackburn brilliantly explain the realist-sounding grammar of our moral discourse but ultimately ground it in the projection of our attitudes, leaving objectivity elusive. Perhaps the most acute challenge comes from evolutionary debunking arguments. As Sharon Street has argued, the evolutionary forces that shaped our core evaluative tendencies were selected for their capacity to enhance reproductive fitness, not to track mind-independent moral truths. For a moral realist, the alignment between these adaptive beliefs and any supposed objective moral truth would be an untenable coincidence.

This paper’s framework, **Emergent Pragmatic Coherentism (EPC)**, offers a form of procedural realism designed to resolve these challenges directly. It is *realist* in positing objective, mind-independent moral truths, but it is *procedural* in that these truths are not mysterious properties but are empirical, relational facts about the long-term viability of social systems. EPC argues that error theory is right about the ontology—there are no queer properties—but wrong about the semantics, because our moral terms have been successfully, if imperfectly, tracking these procedural facts all along. It bypasses the Darwinian Dilemma by collapsing its two horns: systems-level adaptiveness (pragmatic viability) is not a coincidental correlate of moral truth; it is the truth-maker.

This approach leverages a dynamic epistemology established in "The Architecture of Inquiry." That work models our shared knowledge as a public "Network of Predicates"—a fallible, evolving map used to navigate a shared world. The core insight is that these networks are constantly tested by **Pragmatic Pushback**: the non-negotiable feedback from reality that generates real-world costs when a network’s design is misaligned with its environment.

The methodology for measuring this feedback is the **Pragmatic Test**. This is our primary instrument for empirically charting the objective landscape of viability. It is not a single experiment but a programmatic approach to a posteriori inquiry, drawing on the methods of complex systems science and comparative history (Turchin 2003; Tainter 1988). It is designed to diagnose a network's lack of viability by measuring the systemic friction and costs it generates, providing a rigorous, falsifiable standard for an external test of its claims. By applying this test to our normative systems, we can begin to chart the moral landscape.

## **3. The Pragmatic Test: A Diagnostic Methodology**

The Pragmatic Test is the external, empirical methodology that anchors our procedural realism. It is designed to diagnose a normative network's viability by measuring the real-world costs generated when its design collides with the constraints of the moral landscape.

### **3.1 The Constitutive Filter of Endurance**

Before defining our metric, we must justify the authority of the filter itself. The framework is grounded not in a chosen value but in a **constitutive condition**: a system's capacity to endure over time. This is not a normative commitment but a definitional boundary. A network that fails to maintain its informational continuity is not a "failed" network in our dataset; it is an erased one. It is a structural requirement, not a moral one, analogous to how an architect must work with gravity. This move avoids circularity by making persistence a feature of the object of study, not a smuggled premise.

Crucially, this is a systems-level analysis, not a claim about individual motivation. Agents may sacrifice their lives for any number of reasons, but the informational networks that license such sacrifices can only be evaluated if the network itself—through its institutions, texts, and carriers—maintains sufficient continuity. The filter operates on the viability of the informational code, not the psychology of its adherents.

### **3.2 From Mere Endurance to Pragmatic Viability**

This constitutive filter provides the non-normative backdrop for our metric. The measure of the Pragmatic Test is not "survival of the fittest" but **Pragmatic Viability**. We define this as a measure of a system's homeostatic efficiency: its ability to maintain and propagate its core informational structure with minimal systemic cost. This distinction is critical. An oppressive empire that persists for a millennium through brutal force is *enduring*, but it is not *viable*. It is a high-cost, inefficient, and **normatively brittle** system whose stability masks a profound internal fragility. Viability is a measure of a network's systemic health and adaptive efficiency, not just its longevity.

### **3.3 The Diagnostic Toolkit: A Hierarchy of Systemic Costs**

A network's lack of viability manifests as measurable costs. Social friction—eroding trust, breakdowns in cooperation, dissent, and conflict—generates empirical signatures of pragmatic failure. Our diagnostic toolkit organizes these into a causal hierarchy.

| Conceptual Tool         | Definition                                                                  | Potential Empirical Proxies                                                                                              |
| :---------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **First-Order Costs**   | Direct, material consequences of a network's misalignment with reality.     | • Excess mortality/morbidity rates<br>• Frequency of internal violent conflict<br>• Bioarchaeological stress markers |
| **Systemic Costs**      | Non-productive resources spent to manage First-Order Costs.                 | • **Energetic:** Ratio of internal security budget to GDP<br>• **Informational:** State propaganda expenditure; censorship laws |
| **Normative Brittleness** | A network's vulnerability to collapse under novel shocks, caused by high costs. | • High and rising Systemic Costs<br>• Low rates of innovation and adaptation<br>• High dependency on a single resource    |

This causal link is the core of the diagnostic method: high First-Order Costs (e.g., widespread suffering) are the disease; the resulting high Systemic Costs (e.g., a large secret police force) are the fever. One reliably predicts the other, providing falsifiable grounds for diagnosing a network's low pragmatic viability.

### **3.4 The Primary Method: Charting the Negative Canon**

Following Karl Popper, our most reliable knowledge is of what is demonstrably false. The primary empirical project of this methodology is therefore a negative one: the construction of a **Negative Canon**. This is a robust, evidence-based catalogue of "failed normative designs"—predicates empirically shown to generate catastrophic costs, charting the impassable terrain of the moral landscape.

The predicate `slavery is an acceptable organizing principle` belongs in this canon because networks built on it consistently generate immense First-Order Costs (violence, excess mortality) and crippling Systemic Costs (vast resources spent on control), rendering them normatively brittle. A less obvious example, the predicate `political succession should be determined by fratricide`, reliably produced catastrophic civil wars in systems from the Mongol Empire to the Ottoman Empire, placing it firmly in the Negative Canon.

Crucially, the data signaling these failures is generated most intensely at the points of greatest systemic friction. This provides a pragmatic justification for the central insight of standpoint epistemology (Harding 2004). The testimony of the marginalized is epistemically privileged not as a concession to sentiment, but as a diagnostic necessity. Those experiencing the highest First-Order Costs have the most direct access to the data signaling a network’s impending failure.

### **3.5 Methodological Scope and Falsification**

The rigor of the Pragmatic Test depends on clarity about its scope and limitations. First, EPC is a **macro-historical theory of social ethics**. Its diagnostic power is strongest for analyzing large-scale, complex societies, which form its primary evidentiary base. It is not a decision-procedure for individual micro-ethical dilemmas.

Second, we acknowledge that historical events are multi-causal. Our claims are explicitly **probabilistic, not deterministic**. The methodology relies on the tools of comparative historical science: analyzing large datasets to identify statistically significant patterns and using controlled comparisons between societies that faced similar shocks but had different normative structures. The goal is not to prove that a predicate *alone* caused a specific collapse, but to demonstrate with high confidence that it reliably contributes to the normative brittleness that increases the probability of collapse under stress.

Finally, the framework's central causal claim is **falsifiable**. The theory would be decisively broken if broad, cross-cultural historical analysis revealed no statistically significant correlation between a network's internal costs and its long-term viability. If high-friction, coercive systems were consistently found to be no less brittle than low-friction, cooperative ones, the framework's core engine would be falsified.

## **4. Procedural Realism and the Moral Landscape**

With the diagnostic methodology of the Pragmatic Test in place, we can now articulate the positive metaethical framework of Emergent Pragmatic Coherentism (EPC). EPC defends a procedural realism where moral truths are not invented but are objective, mind-independent facts about which principles of social organization prove maximally viable against real-world constraints.

### **4.1 The Apex Network: An Emergent Fitness Landscape**

The object of our moral inquiry is the **Apex Network**. To avoid metaphysical confusion, it is crucial to be precise about its ontological status. The Apex Network is not a pre-existing Platonic realm but an **emergent structural fact**, analogous to a "fitness landscape" in evolutionary biology. It is the real, mind-independent set of constraints and viable solutions that emerges from the interaction between social systems and the non-negotiable pressures of reality. Its objectivity is grounded in the fact that these pressures are universal; its structure is discovered empirically, primarily by charting its boundaries via the Negative Canon of failed designs.

A moral claim, on this view, is a falsifiable hypothesis about the long-term viability of a specific organizational principle. Moral terms like "...is wrong" or "...is just" are predicates—functional tools used to codify these principles. To be precise about what is being tested, we must distinguish the unit of selection. A network's informational structure—its core normative predicates and their relations—is the **replicator**. The social group and its institutions are the **interactor**, the physical vessel through which this informational code is instantiated and tested. The objective truth of a moral claim, therefore, is determined by the long-term viability of its underlying informational code as a successful replicator.

### **4.2 Moral Progress as Systemic Debugging**

EPC provides a robust, non-teleological account of moral progress as a real, observable phenomenon. Progress is not a march toward a utopian endpoint but the backward-looking, problem-solving process of debugging our societal maps to better align with the landscape of viability. This occurs by identifying and removing predicates from the Negative Canon.

The historical abolition of chattel slavery serves as the paradigm case. The predicate `slavery is an acceptable organizing principle` was always objectively false, meaning it was incoherent with the real landscape of viability. This incoherence manifested as catastrophic First-Order Costs and crippling Systemic Costs, including a high **Coercion Ratio** (resources spent on control versus production) and a high **Patch Velocity** (the accelerating need for ad-hoc ideological justifications). The system endured not because it was viable, but by accumulating a crippling level of systemic fragility. The triumph of abolition was therefore not a mere change of opinion but a profound act of epistemic correction: a demonstrably failed design principle was erased from the map.

This "debugging" can also occur through the gradual reduction of systemic costs. Consider the expansion of women’s rights. The exclusion of women from public and economic life generated immense, though often uncounted, costs in the form of lost productivity, innovation, and social capital. The gradual inclusion of women represents a systemic upgrade that demonstrably lowered these costs, increasing the overall viability and resilience of the networks that adopted it. This was progress because the resulting social design was better aligned with the landscape of viability.

### **4.3 The Objective Topography of the Landscape**

Our procedural realism predicts that the landscape of viability has an objective topography, with features we can map empirically.

1.  **The Convergent Core: The "Mountain Passes."** This consists of universally viable normative predicates that represent singular, or near-singular, stable solutions to universal coordination problems. These are the "mountain passes" of the pragmatic landscape—narrow routes any successful network must discover. Norms of basic reciprocity, for example, are a likely candidate, representing a game-theoretically stable solution to the Prisoner's Dilemma that has emerged independently across countless cultures (Axelrod 1984).

2.  **The Pluralist Periphery: The "Viable Plains."** This accounts for legitimate cultural disagreements without collapsing into relativism. It corresponds to the "viable plains" of the landscape—broad areas where multiple, culturally-specific yet equally viable routes exist. A well-regulated capitalist welfare state and a robust social democracy, for example, may represent distinct but demonstrably viable strategies for organizing a modern economy. The debate between them is an empirical negotiation over second-order costs, not a sign that one must be objectively wrong.

This two-tiered structure grounds a robust, non-parochial cultural critique. The judgment that a practice like "honor killings" is objectively wrong is not rooted in cultural superiority. It is a falsifiable empirical claim: the practice reliably generates catastrophic First-Order Costs and belongs firmly in the Negative Canon, representing an attempt to chart a path through impassable terrain.

### **4.4 Ethics as Systemic Moral Risk Assessment**

The framework's true test lies in its application to ambiguous, contemporary issues. Here, its value is as a diagnostic, not a dogmatic, tool. It transforms intractable value-clashes into a shared research program by reframing ethics as a form of **Systemic Moral Risk Assessment**. It generates falsifiable hypotheses about the long-term viability of competing social technologies.

For instance, the debate over different models of economic organization can be framed as a set of competing hypotheses about long-term systemic costs. One model might prioritize short-term growth at the cost of generating high First-Order Costs in environmental degradation and social inequality, leading to long-term normative brittleness. An alternative model might accept lower short-term growth as an "investment" to build a more resilient, low-cost system. By framing complex issues as competing, falsifiable hypotheses about measurable pragmatic consequences, EPC transforms moral debate from a conflict of wills into a shared diagnostic project.

## **5. Defending the Model: Answering Core Objections**

With the EPC framework articulated, we now test its resilience against the most pressing objections. The model's ability to provide robust, non-circular answers to these challenges strengthens its case as a naturalistic framework for moral objectivity.

### **5.1 Objection: The Stability of Evil ("Might Makes Right")**

A critic might argue that a society that endures for millennia, no matter how oppressive, must have "won" the pragmatic test, making its predicates objectively viable. This objection rests on a crucial error: it mistakes mere endurance for the richer, diagnostic concept of pragmatic viability.

As established, viability is a measure of a system's homeostatic efficiency. An oppressive state that persists through coercion is, by definition, not viable; its endurance is a measure of the immense energy it burns to manage its own self-inflicted instability. Using our diagnostic toolkit, we can observe the high costs of this inefficiency: a high **Coercion Ratio**, immense **Informational Costs** for propaganda and censorship, and an accelerating **Patch Velocity** of ad-hoc justifications.

Such systems often persist by becoming trapped in a sub-optimal but stable equilibrium. Their inherent normative brittleness is only fully revealed when they face a significant exogenous shock—a new technology, a climate crisis, or contact with a more viable network. The long peace of a "stable evil" is often the prelude to a sudden shattering. Its endurance does not make its predicates true; it merely makes it a long-running, fragile experiment whose wreckage we chart to build the Negative Canon.

### **5.2 Objection: The Power of Ideology**

A more sophisticated objection concedes that oppressive systems generate costs but argues that ideology can convince agents to endure pragmatic failure indefinitely, for instance by framing suffering as a noble trial. This objection correctly identifies a key tactic in network evolution, but it underestimates its non-negotiable price.

Ideological patches are never pragmatically free. They introduce cascading Systemic Costs that are themselves powerful diagnostic indicators of dysfunction. To maintain a flawed core predicate, a network must invest heavily in an expensive apparatus of ideological maintenance. The very need for this costly insulation is an epistemic red flag. We have a powerful pragmatic reason to be deeply skeptical of any network that requires immense and continuous energy expenditure to suppress dissent and explain away suffering. The presence of these defense mechanisms is a primary signal that the network’s core predicates are misaligned with reality, giving us reason to heed dissenters as the canaries in the coal mine of systemic failure.

### **5.3 Objection: Is This Just Consequentialism?**

A third objection might claim that by evaluating normative systems based on their real-world costs and outcomes, EPC is simply a form of rule-consequentialism. This conflates two distinct modes of evaluation. Consequentialism is a forward-looking, teleological theory that aims to maximize a specific outcome (e.g., utility). EPC, by contrast, is a backward-looking, procedural, and non-teleological framework.

EPC does not seek to maximize a future good. Its standard is viability—the ability of a system to maintain its own structure with minimal cost. Its methodology is eliminative and historical, identifying what fails rather than prescribing a single path to what succeeds. It is a viability-filtering model, not an outcome-maximizing one. The "good" that emerges is resilience and stability, but these are emergent properties of successful design, not a pre-defined goal to be pursued.

### **5.4 The Grounding Problem Revisited**

The final and most fundamental challenge is that the theory appears circular, smuggling in the ultimate value of endurance. This objection misunderstands the model's two-part, non-circular defense.

First, the grounding filter is **constitutive, not normative**. Endurance is not a value to be chosen from a list; it is a definitional feature of the systems we study. A network that fails to maintain its informational continuity over time is not a "failed" network; it is an erased one. To analyze a network's historical track record at all is to select from the pool of systems that have already met this non-negotiable structural condition. This argument does not prove "endurance is good"; it shows that endurance functions as the inescapable, non-normative arena in which the viability of all other values is tested.

Second, the "ought" that emerges from EPC is a **wide-scope, instrumental imperative**. It does not derive a categorical command from descriptive premises. Instead, it offers strategic advice: *if* a system has a de facto commitment to persisting through time (which any inquiring system already has), *then* it has a powerful, evidence-based reason to adopt predicates that enhance pragmatic viability and avoid those in the Negative Canon. Its normative force arises through internal critique, supplying a standard of rationality for the ongoing project of any society that seeks to endure.

## **6. Situating EPC in the Metaethical Landscape**

Emergent Pragmatic Coherentism is not an isolated proposal but a synthesis that carves out a unique position in metaethics. It offers a form of moral realism that is staunchly naturalistic; a form of pragmatism that grounds a robust, externalist objectivity; and an evolutionary theory that provides a powerful response to anti-realist and debunking arguments. This section will situate the EPC model by demonstrating its distinct advantages over major rival accounts.

### **6.1 A Procedural, Externalist Realism**

EPC is a form of **procedural realism**. It is *realist* in positing objective, mind-independent truths about the viability of normative systems. It is *procedural* in that these truths are not mysterious, *sui generis* properties, but are the observable, empirical outcomes of the Pragmatic Test. The truth-makers for moral claims are the objective, historical facts about which network designs generate lower systemic costs and greater resilience. The "wrongness" of a predicate is thus an emergent, relational property, much as the "fitness" of an organism is a real property of its relationship with an environment.

This externalist, systems-level focus distinguishes EPC from other influential naturalist realisms. Cornell Realists, for instance, ground moral facts in agent-centric properties, such as an individual's "objective interests" (Railton 1986). EPC’s framework is more robustly externalist because it formally shifts the unit of evaluation to the multi-generational viability of the network's **informational code itself**. This allows EPC to make an objective judgment on the failure of a tyrant’s network—its code is a poor long-term replicator due to the systemic costs it generates—a fact entirely independent of the tyrant's own interests.

### **6.2 Explanatory Power Against Anti-Realism**

EPC's procedural realism provides deeper, naturalistic diagnoses of the core anti-realist challenges. We agree with J. L. Mackie’s (1977) "argument from queerness": there are no strange, non-natural, intrinsically prescriptive properties woven into the fabric of the world. Mackie’s error was not his ontology but his semantics. He rightly rejected the folk-metaphysical gloss on moral terms but wrongly concluded this entailed a failure of reference. EPC offers a more powerful diagnosis: our moral discourse has been engaged in successful but mis-glossed reference. Moral terms have been successfully, if imperfectly, tracking real, procedural facts about the pragmatic viability of social arrangements all along. The "objective wrongness" of slavery is not a queer property; it is a real, relational, and empirically discoverable property of a predicate that reliably generates catastrophic systemic costs.

This same move demonstrates why the ingenious project of quasi-realism (Blackburn 1993), which seeks to explain how we can "earn the right" to realist-sounding grammar, gets the causal story backward. A quasi-realist might argue that EPC's "viability facts" are still just projections of our attitudes onto history. But this misunderstands the nature of systemic costs. Excess mortality, violent conflict, and resource depletion are not attitude-dependent projections; they are objective, measurable signals of pragmatic failure. The realist-sounding grammar of our moral claims is not something our attitudes needed to earn; it is a feature our language evolved to have because it has always been tracking an objective, procedural reality.

### **6.3 Transforming the Darwinian Dilemma**

This framework transforms Sharon Street’s (2006) "Darwinian Dilemma" from a challenge into a confirmation. Street poses a formidable challenge to any realism that must treat the correlation between our adaptive moral beliefs and any supposed moral truth as an untenable coincidence. EPC resolves this dilemma by collapsing one of its horns so completely that it becomes the foundation of the other. For EPC, there is no coincidence to explain. Pragmatic viability—a specified, systems-level form of adaptiveness—is not a coincidental correlate of moral truth; it is the **truth-maker itself**. Evolution is not a distorting influence the realist must explain away; it is the very filtering process that grounds objectivity. Street's debunking argument becomes a causal explanation for our realism.

### **6.4 An Externalist Alternative to Other Naturalisms and Proceduralisms**

EPC's systems-level externalism distinguishes it from other influential rivals. Unlike the Neo-Aristotelian project (Foot 2001), which grounds normativity in a thick, teleological concept of "human flourishing," EPC's metric is the thin, procedural standard of viability, allowing it to robustly account for the Pluralist Periphery where multiple forms of life may prove viable.

It also differs fundamentally from **moral constructivism**. Thinkers in the Kantian or Rawlsian tradition ground moral truths in the outcomes of idealized procedures of rational agreement. While also procedural, these accounts are *internalist*—truth is constructed out of the structure of practical reason itself. EPC, by contrast, is staunchly *externalist*. The procedure is not a hypothetical thought experiment but the actual, messy, historical process of pragmatic selection. Moral truth is not constructed by ideal reasoners; it is discovered through the empirical analysis of which real-world systems endure and which collapse.

## **7. Conclusion: Moral Inquiry as Pragmatic Navigation**

This paper began with one of philosophy's oldest chasms: the gap between "is" and "ought." We have argued that this chasm is not a feature of reality but an artifact of a static epistemology. Once inquiry is reframed as a single, multi-generational, and fundamentally pragmatic project, the divide dissolves. The goal of this project, whether in science or ethics, is the construction of ever more viable maps for navigating a shared reality.

Emergent Pragmatic Coherentism offers a unified theory of justification where both descriptive and normative claims are adjudicated in the same court of long-term pragmatic selection. This grounds a robust procedural realism with three significant payoffs. First, it naturalizes moral objectivity, allowing us to state with empirical confidence that abolishing slavery was not a mere change of opinion but a profound act of epistemic correction—the debugging of our societal code by removing a demonstrably failed design principle from our Negative Canon.

Second, it provides a powerful, non-teleological model of moral progress. Progress occurs when we treat suffering, dissent, and instability not as political problems to be managed, but as primary epistemological data. They are the signals of a misalignment between our normative map and the unforgiving constraints of the real landscape. This gives us a powerful, pragmatic reason to listen to the marginalized, as those experiencing the highest costs possess the most crucial information about where our collective map is wrong.

Finally, it naturalizes the authority of an "ought." This authority is not found in a mysterious metaphysical realm or in the structure of rational agency alone, but in the immense, procedural weight of historical evidence. An "ought," on this view, is a time-tested design principle—a hard-won empirical discovery that a particular path represents a viable strategy for the shared project of human cooperation.

Ultimately, EPC is more than a solution to a philosophical puzzle; it is an invitation to re-found moral inquiry as a form of **Systemic Moral Risk Assessment**. It provides a framework for diagnosing the hidden costs and latent fragilities within our most cherished institutions and for making evidence-based wagers about the long-term viability of proposed reforms. It reframes moral philosophy from a search for ultimate foundations to the ongoing, fallible craft of pragmatic navigation: the art of steering by the light of humanity's most enduring successes and the hard-won lessons from the wreckage that marks the impassable terrain on our collective map of viability.


## **Glossary**

**Apex Network:** The real, mind-independent, and emergent object of moral inquiry. It is not a transcendent Platonic Form but the objective, structured "landscape of viability" containing the complete, trans-historical set of maximally viable design principles for social organization. Its features are discovered empirically, primarily by charting its boundaries via the **Negative Canon**.

**Convergent Core:** An objective, topological feature of the **Apex Network**. It consists of a set of universally viable normative predicates representing singular, or near-singular, stable solutions to universal coordination problems (e.g., norms of reciprocity). These are the non-negotiable "mountain passes" of the pragmatic landscape.

**Drive to Endure:** The ultimate, non-normative filter grounding the EPC framework, established by a naturalized transcendental argument. It is not a chosen value but the constitutive precondition for any system of inquiry to exist over time—an inescapable structural constraint analogous to gravity in architecture.

**Emergent Pragmatic Coherentism (EPC):** The full metaethical framework of this paper. It grounds a **Procedural Realism** by synthesizing a dynamic, coherentist epistemology (the Network of Predicates) with an evolutionary, externalist standard of justification (the Pragmatic Test).

**Epistemic Debt:** The accumulating future costs in fragility and incoherence incurred when a network adopts a flawed "patch" (e.g., ideology) to protect a core predicate from **Pragmatic Pushback**, rather than undertaking a more viable core revision.

**First-Order Costs:** The direct, material, and measurable consequences of a network's misalignment with the landscape of viability (e.g., excess mortality, systemic violence, resource depletion). They are the primary, objective data for the **Pragmatic Test**.

**Functional Transformation:** The core learning mechanism in a **Network of Predicates**. It is the process by which a well-tested, pragmatically successful proposition is repurposed from mere data *within* the network to become part of the network's *core processing architecture* (e.g., a foundational legal principle).

**Mere Endurance:** The simple persistence of a system over time, strictly distinguished from **Pragmatic Viability**. A system can endure through high-cost, coercive means, making it **normatively brittle**. Endurance alone is often a lagging indicator of eventual collapse.

**Negative Canon:** The primary epistemological tool of the **Pragmatic Test**. It is a robust, evidence-based catalogue of "failed normative designs"—predicates empirically demonstrated to reliably generate catastrophic **First-Order Costs**. It functions as our most reliable map of the impassable terrain of the **Apex Network**.

**Network of Predicates (or Shared Network):** The public, structural system of shared knowledge that is the primary unit of selection. It emerges from the forced convergence of individual "webs of belief" under the pressure of shared pragmatic tasks and **Pragmatic Pushback**.

**Normative Brittleness:** A network's inherent vulnerability to external shocks. It is the direct consequence of high **Systemic Costs** and **Epistemic Debt**, as resources are diverted from adaptation to internal control. It is the functional inverse of resilience.

**Pluralist Periphery:** An objective, topological feature of the **Apex Network**. It represents the "viable plains" of the pragmatic landscape where multiple, culturally-specific yet equally viable solutions to an organizational problem exist. It accounts for legitimate moral disagreement without relativism, as the entire periphery is bounded by the **Negative Canon**.

**Pragmatic Pushback:** The non-negotiable, often non-propositional, feedback from reality that exerts selective pressure on a network. It is the sum of functional successes and failures that generates the **First-Order Costs** measured by the **Pragmatic Test**.

**Pragmatic Test:** The overall methodology for the external validation of a **Network of Predicates**. It is a programmatic, empirical research program designed to assess a network's **Pragmatic Viability** by analyzing its total systemic costs over time.

**Pragmatic Viability:** The objective metric of a network's success, distinct from **Mere Endurance**. It is a measure of a system's homeostatic efficiency: its ability to maintain its informational structure while minimizing its total **Systemic Costs**. High viability indicates a network is well-aligned with the **Apex Network**.

**Predicate:** The "gene" of cultural evolution; the basic functional unit of a claim within a network. It is a reusable informational tool (e.g., `...is wrong`, `...is an atom`) whose deployment has testable, real-world consequences.

**Procedural Realism:** The metaethical stance of EPC. It is *realist* in positing objective, mind-independent moral truths, but *procedural* in that these truth-makers are not mysterious properties but are objective, empirical facts about which organizational principles cohere with the real, emergent structure of the **Apex Network**.

**Systemic Costs:** The secondary, non-productive energetic and informational costs a network must pay to manage its **First-Order Costs** (e.g., resources spent on coercion, surveillance, and propaganda). The total systemic cost of a network is the primary inverse indicator of its **Pragmatic Viability**.
