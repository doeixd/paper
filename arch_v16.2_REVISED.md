# **Convergent Coherence: How Failure Forges the Emergent Structure of Objective Truth**

## **Abstract**

Coherentist theories face a persistent challenge: the isolation objection holds that internally coherent belief systems may remain entirely detached from reality. This paper develops Emergent Pragmatic Coherentism (EPC), resolving this objection through a novel externalist mechanism that grounds coherence in demonstrated pragmatic viability. We operationalize viability through "systemic brittleness"—a measurable diagnostic tracking the accumulating costs knowledge systems incur when misaligned with reality. The framework's core innovation is showing how pragmatic pushback—material consequences of applying flawed principles—functions as a selective filter, progressively eliminating high-brittleness systems while revealing an objective structure we term the Apex Network. Unlike foundationalist accounts, this structure is not metaphysically given but emerges as a stable attractor: the configuration surviving iterative pragmatic filtering across domains. EPC thus transforms Quine's static web of belief into a dynamic evolutionary model, explaining how individual webs under shared pragmatic constraints converge on low-brittleness Shared Networks. The result is a naturalistic realism where objective truth represents alignment with pragmatically unavoidable constraints, grounding a falsifiable research program with diagnostic tools applicable to science, institutions, and normative systems.

## **1. Introduction: The Isolation Problem and Pragmatic Resolution**

### **1.1 A Tale of Two Networks**

Why did germ theory replace miasma theory? The standard answer—superior empirical evidence—is true but incomplete. A deeper analysis reveals a story about systemic viability and structural failure. Although miasma theory's emphasis on sanitation produced some positive public health effects, its core principles were degenerating. The network exhibited high systemic brittleness: it generated catastrophic costs (thousands died in London when efforts focused on odors rather than contaminated water sources), required an accelerating number of ad hoc modifications (explaining why "bad air" killed only near specific water pumps), and offered no generative explanatory power. Germ theory, by contrast, proved dramatically more viable—it reduced these costs through effective interventions and unified diverse phenomena under a single, powerful conceptual framework (BonJour 1985, pp. 93-95; Kuhn 1996, pp. 82-92).

This historical episode exemplifies the dynamic this paper formalizes: knowledge systems succeed or fail not merely through logical consistency but through demonstrated capacity to minimize what we term "systemic costs"—the measurable burdens systems incur managing their own dysfunctions.

### **1.2 The Isolation Objection and Its Significance**

The isolation objection poses a fundamental challenge to coherentist epistemology: a perfectly coherent belief system could, in principle, remain entirely detached from reality—a "sophisticated delusion" (BonJour 1985, p. 93). While coherentists have developed various responses (Olsson 2005, pp. 50-60; Kvanvig 2012, pp. 25-30), most rely on internalist resources insufficient to provide the robust external constraint coherentism requires. Even sophisticated accounts like Haack's (1993, pp. 120-125) foundherentism, which blends coherence with foundational "clues," leave the connection between coherence and truth-conduciveness underspecified.

Recent work has advanced our understanding of belief structure within Quinean holism (Carlson 2015, pp. 5-15), demonstrating asymmetries in the web of belief. Yet the question remains: what external pressures forge this structure? What prevents the web from becoming an isolated, self-referential system?

### **1.3 The Framework's Solution: Pragmatic Externalism**

This paper develops Emergent Pragmatic Coherentism (EPC) as a systematic response. EPC grounds coherence in the demonstrated long-term viability of entire knowledge systems, operationalized through their historical capacity to minimize systemic costs. Drawing on resilience theory from systems ecology (Holling 1973, pp. 14-17) and fragility analysis (Taleb 2012, pp. 25-40), we model how individual agents' holistic web revisions in response to "recalcitrant experience"—what we generalize as pragmatic pushback—drive bottom-up convergence on more viable, less fragile public knowledge systems.

The framework makes four key contributions:

**First**, it provides precise operationalization of systemic health through measurable indicators: rates of ad-hoc modification, resource allocation to coercion versus adaptation, and model complexity trajectories (Section 2).

**Second**, it explains convergence without presupposing metaphysical foundations. The Apex Network—objective knowledge structure—emerges as a stable attractor through iterative pragmatic filtering, not as a pre-existing blueprint (Section 4).

**Third**, it unifies descriptive and normative inquiry under a single mechanism, explaining both epistemic brittleness (misalignment with causal structure) and normative brittleness (misalignment with emergent normative constraints) through the same diagnostic framework (Section 2.5).

**Fourth**, it grounds a falsifiable research program with clear success criteria: systems exhibiting high or rising brittleness should show statistically elevated collapse rates under comparable conditions (Section 7).

### **1.4 Scope and Positioning**

To prevent misunderstanding, we must specify what this framework does and does not attempt. This is not a foundationalist epistemology seeking indubitable starting points, nor a general theory applicable to all domains. Rather, EPC is a specialized framework for cumulative knowledge systems—ongoing, inter-generational projects where claims build on previous work and practical consequences provide performance feedback.

**Primary domain**: The framework applies most directly to empirical science, legal systems, engineering, and public policy—domains where pragmatic pushback is relatively direct and measurable.

**Theoretical domains**: Application to purely theoretical areas (mathematics, formal logic) requires additional development and may prove limited. We present this focus as a feature, not a defect: the framework's power lies precisely in its applicability to knowledge systems where failure has observable consequences.

**Macro-epistemology**: This is a theory of long-term systemic viability, not individual belief justification. It models inquiry as evolutionary cultivation of viable public knowledge systems through Lamarckian-style directed adaptation (intentional learning) rather than purely Darwinian selection.

### **1.5 Distinguishing Viability from Mere Persistence**

A crucial distinction: we define viability not as mere endurance but as sustainably low systemic costs. A brutal empire persisting through coercion is not viable in our terms but exemplifies high brittleness—its longevity measures the immense energy wasted suppressing instability. Viability is thus relational: a system's capacity to solve problems within its pragmatic environment with low ongoing costs.

### **1.6 Incorporating Power and Contingency**

Any credible evolutionary epistemology must address power, path dependence, and historical contingency. EPC incorporates these not as exceptions but as core variables. Power exercised to maintain brittle systems is not a refutation but a primary indicator of non-viability, measured through coercive costs. The framework's claims are probabilistic, not deterministic: beneath historical contingency's surface noise lie structural pressures. Systems accumulating brittleness—analogous to Taleb's (2012, pp. 25-40) fragility concept—face progressively higher vulnerability to contingent shocks.

This model does not offer deterministic historical prediction but provides foundations for probabilistic analysis of structural dynamics shaping the landscape on which historical events unfold.

### **1.7 Relationship to Existing Frameworks**

**Versus Lakatos**: While Lakatos (1970, pp. 116-118) described degenerating research programs qualitatively, EPC provides quantitative diagnostics and extends analysis beyond science to institutions and normative systems.

**Versus Classical Pragmatism**: Building on Dewey and Peirce's insights about inquiry as problem-solving, EPC operationalizes "what works" through measurable brittleness indicators and provides a convergence mechanism explaining how local problem-solving yields global objective structures.

**Versus Bayesian Epistemology**: The frameworks are complementary. Bayesianism addresses individual belief updating; EPC addresses collective system evolution. Systemic brittleness provides higher-order evidence informing rational priors: claims from low-brittleness systems warrant higher credence (Staffel 2019, pp. 45-50).

### **1.8 Roadmap**

The paper proceeds as follows: Section 2 develops the diagnostic framework for systemic viability. Section 3 explains the evolutionary drivers producing convergence. Section 4 details how the Apex Network emerges and grounds objective truth. Section 5 provides the dynamic account of web structure formation. Section 6 situates EPC against alternatives, demonstrating how it resolves the isolation objection where rivals fail. Section 7 outlines the falsifiable research program with concrete testable predictions.
