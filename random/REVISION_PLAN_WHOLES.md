# Implementation Plan - Improving "The Reality of Wholes"

Based on the guidelines in `CLAUDE.md`, the AI suggestions provided in the request, and the notes in `wholeparts-convo.txt`, I will refine "The Reality of Wholes.md" to strengthen its philosophical arguments and improve its academic clarity.

## 1. Strengthen the Distinction Between Observer-Relativity and Constraint-Relativity
- **Goal**: Clarify that while dimensions of closure may depend on human systems (like Law), they are objectively real once the constraints are established.
- **Action**: In Part 3 or Part 7, integrate the "Chess" and "Law" analogies. Use the "Stop paying taxes" illustration to show the "hardness" of social reality.
- **Rationale**: This addresses the common "subjectivism" critique more robustly by distinguishing between origin (human-made) and ontology (functional necessity).

## 2. Refine the Defense Against Trivial Entities
- **Goal**: Make the distinction between "natural joints" and "gerrymandered surfaces" more precise.
- **Action**: Introduce the concept of "Informational Parasites" to describe trivial entities (like "Shoe-Moon"). Explain that these cost cognitive energy without providing "causal profit" or compression.
- **Rationale**: Uses more evocative and precise terminology from the provided AI suggestions.

## 3. Elaborate on Cross-Dimensional Interaction
- **Goal**: Explain how orthogonal dimensions (like Legal and Physical) interact without collapsing.
- **Action**: Introduce the "Implementation Layer" concept. Use the specific causal chain of a "Judge signing a warrant" leading to physical arrest as an illustration.
- **Rationale**: Clarifies the "soft hierarchy" where higher-level dimensions are tethered to the physical substrate through existential dependency.

## 4. Introduce the Four Axes of Realness
- **Goal**: Provide a more nuanced scoring system for "how real" something is.
- **Action**: Define and distinguish between:
    - **Causal Closure**: Effectiveness of the boundary.
    - **Fundamentality**: Level in the abstraction/implementation hierarchy.
    - **Constraint Tightness**: How negotiable the boundaries are (Thermodynamics vs. Aesthetics).
    - **Sharedness**: Convergence of agents (Universal invariants vs. specialist expertise).
- **Rationale**: Helps resolve the "rock vs. race" or "rock vs. corporation" intuition by showing they score differently on different axes.

## 5. Style and Formatting Refinement (CLAUDE.md compliance)
- **Mathematical Formatting**: Convert all variables and information-theoretic terms (e.g., $P(inside)$, $v$-machine, $\varepsilon$-machine) to LaTeX math delimiters (`$ ... $`).
- **Punctuation**: Ensure no em-dashes are used (replace with semicolons or restructuring).
- **Tone**: Maintain the "simple, clear, authoritative but humble" academic voice.
- **Citations**: Ensure citations are consistent with the Chicago style specified.

## 6. Self-Correction and Consistency Check
- Ensure that the "Computational Closure" and "ε/υ-machine" explanations remain the technical core.
- Verify that the "Hotdog" and "Trumpet" examples are properly integrated with the new "Implementation Layer" and "Four Axes" concepts.
