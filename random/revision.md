# Revision Plan for paper.md
## Based on Modal/Necessity Framework Discussion

**Date:** 2025-10-06
**Purpose:** This document provides a complete, step-by-step plan for revising paper.md to incorporate the modal/necessity interpretation of the Apex Network and strengthen the framework's philosophical foundations.

---

## **Core Theoretical Shift**

### **FROM:** Historical/Empirical Apex Network
- Apex Network = what happened to survive through historical filtering
- Discovered retrospectively through actual failures
- Contingent on which experiments were run

### **TO:** Modal/Necessary Apex Network
- Apex Network = **the optimal structure that MUST exist given constraint space**
- Determined by mind-independent pragmatic constraints
- **Counterfactually stable** (would be same in alternative histories)
- Discovered through history, but exists independently as the solution space

### **Key Conceptual Addition**
The Apex Network exists as **determined structure** - like the solution to a constrained optimization problem. It exists whether we've discovered it or not, determined by:
- Physical laws (thermodynamics, resource scarcity)
- Biological facts (human needs, mortality, cooperation requirements)
- Logical requirements (consistency)
- Coordination necessities (collective action problems)

---

## **MAJOR STRUCTURAL ADDITIONS**

### ✅ **Task 1: Add New Subsection 4.2.1 - Modal Status of Apex Network**

**Location:** Insert immediately after Section 4.2 first paragraph (after "The Apex Network is the emergent structure...")

**Action:** ADD NEW SUBSECTION

**Full text to insert:**

```markdown
#### 4.2.1 The Modal Status of the Apex Network

The Apex Network is not merely what happened to survive through historical contingency. It is the optimal structure that must exist given the constraint space of reality. This distinction is crucial for understanding the framework's claim to objectivity.

**The Necessity Argument:**

1. Reality imposes non-negotiable constraints: physical laws (thermodynamics, resource scarcity), biological facts (human needs, mortality, cooperation requirements), logical requirements (consistency), and coordination necessities (collective action problems).

2. These constraints determine a fitness landscape of possible social configurations. A topology where some paths are viable and others catastrophic.

3. There exists an optimal configuration (or compact set of optimal configurations) for navigating these constraints, just as there exists an optimal solution to a constrained optimization problem whether anyone has calculated it.

4. The Apex Network IS that optimal structure. The configuration space of maximally viable solutions. It exists whether we've discovered it or not, determined by constraints rather than by our beliefs about it.

**Historical filtering is how we discover this structure, not how we create it.** Failed systems are experiments revealing where the landscape drops off. The Negative Canon maps the canyons and cliffs. Over time, with sufficient experiments across diverse conditions, we triangulate toward the peaks.

This makes moral objectivity analogous to mathematical objectivity: π existed before humans calculated it, determined by the relationship between circumference and diameter. Similarly, optimal social configurations exist before discovery, determined by pragmatic constraints. Both are mind-independent structural facts about solution spaces.

**Counterfactual Stability:** If human history had unfolded differently, if different societies had run different experiments, we would have discovered the same Apex Network structure through alternative paths. The Negative Canon might contain different specific examples, but the underlying structural facts about what works and what fails would remain constant, just as alternative civilizations would discover the same mathematical truths.

This answers the historical contingency objection: our map is contingent and fallible, but the territory is necessary and determinate.
```

**Rationale:** This establishes the modal/necessity claim that transforms the framework from empirical/historical to necessity-based while remaining naturalistically grounded.

---

### ✅ **Task 2: Revise Section 4.3 - Three Levels of Truth**

**Location:** Section 4.3, table row for "Level 1: Objective Truth"

**Action:** REPLACE the Level 1 description

**Delete:**
```
* **Level 1: Objective Truth.** Part of Apex Network | Convergence limit
```

**Replace with:**
```
* **Level 1: Objective Truth.** The ultimate standard. A proposition is objectively true if its principles are part of the real, emergent **Apex Network** - the necessary structure of optimal solutions determined by mind-independent pragmatic constraints. This structure exists whether we have discovered it or not, just as mathematical truths exist independent of calculation. While we can never achieve certainty that our current Consensus Network perfectly maps it, the Apex Network functions as the objective standard that makes our comparative judgments of "more" or "less" brittle meaningful. It is ontologically real (determined by constraints) yet epistemically a regulative ideal (we approach it asymptotically through historical filtering).
```

**Rationale:** Incorporates the modal necessity claim into the truth definition, making clear the dual ontological/epistemic status.

---

### ✅ **Task 3: Completely Rewrite Section 6.4 - Mathematics**

**Location:** Section 6.4 entire section

**Action:** REPLACE ENTIRE SECTION

**Delete:** Current Section 6.4 content (starting "The framework operates..." through "...delay brittleness diagnostics.")

**Replace with:**

```markdown
### 6.4 Mathematics as Paradigm Case, Not Boundary Condition

**Scope**: Mathematics is often treated as a challenge for naturalistic epistemologies. The framework shows instead how mathematical knowledge exemplifies its core mechanisms.

**Mathematical Brittleness Manifests as Internal Inefficiency:**

Just as physical theories face external pragmatic pushback through failed predictions, mathematical frameworks face internal pragmatic pushback through:

- **Proof complexity escalation**: Increasing proof length without proportional explanatory gain
- **Axiom proliferation**: Ad-hoc modifications to patch paradoxes (mathematical "epicycles")
- **Contradiction generation**: Russell's paradox in naive set theory generated infinite brittleness, paralyzing all inference
- **Loss of unifying power**: Fragmented domains requiring separate treatment

**Operationalizing Mathematical Brittleness:**

Consider the response to Russell's paradox. Two alternative low-brittleness strategies emerged:

1. **ZF Set Theory**: Added axioms (Replacement, Foundation) to patch the paradox. Higher M(t) (more axioms) but maintains classical logic and proof methods.

2. **Type Theory**: Stratified hierarchy avoiding paradox structurally. Different complexity profile but arguably lower conceptual debt.

Both represent attempts to reduce the brittleness naive set theory exhibited. Historical adoption patterns reveal which proved more pragmatically viable for different mathematical domains.

**Why Logic Occupies the Core:**

Logic isn't metaphysically privileged - it's functionally indispensable. Revising it would generate infinite brittleness: you cannot perform the cost-benefit analysis to assess a revision to logic without using logic. This maximal entrenchment follows from bounded rationality (Simon 1972), not a priori necessity.

**Addressing Power Dynamics:**

Engaging feminist epistemology (Harding 1991), institutional suppression of alternative proof methods or foundational approaches delays brittleness detection. When dominant mathematical communities use coercive tactics (career punishment, publication barriers) to enforce orthodoxy, this generates measurable systemic costs: innovation lags, talented mathematicians driven from field, fragmentation of subdisciplines. These C(t) indicators signal brittleness in mathematical practice, not just theory.

**The General Point:** Mathematics demonstrates the framework's universality. All domains - physical, social, mathematical - face pragmatic selection. The feedback mechanism varies (external prediction vs. internal coherence), but the underlying filter is the same: systems accumulating brittleness are replaced by more viable alternatives.
```

**Rationale:** Reframes mathematics from limitation to paradigm case, showing how internal brittleness operates just like external brittleness. Strengthens universality claim.

---

### ✅ **Task 4: Add Section 2.2.1 - Causal Hierarchy Resolves Circularity**

**Location:** Insert after Section 2.2 (after the replicator/interactor discussion)

**Action:** ADD NEW SUBSECTION

**Full text to insert:**

```markdown
### 2.2.1 How the Causal Hierarchy Addresses the Circularity Objection

A persistent objection claims the framework cannot classify spending as "productive" vs. "coercive" without prior normative commitments. The causal hierarchy provides an operational decision procedure resolving this.

**The Three-Step Classification Protocol:**

1. **Measure trajectories**: Track resource allocation patterns over time (security/suppression vs. infrastructure/R&D/public health)

2. **Correlate with First-Order Costs**: Do demographic indicators (mortality, morbidity), economic output, and stability improve or deteriorate?

3. **Apply diagnostic rule**: A spending category is presumptively coercive rather than productive when:
   - Increasing allocation correlates with rising First-Order Costs
   - The system requires accelerating investment to maintain baseline stability
   - Returns are diminishing (more input, same or worse output)

**Example: Criminal Justice Classification**

Scenario A:
- Police spending doubles
- Crime rates fall, incarceration rates fall
- Community trust metrics rise, recidivism declines
- **Diagnosis**: Productive investment (reduced First-Order Costs)

Scenario B:
- Police spending doubles
- Crime rates stable or rise, incarceration explodes
- Community trust collapses, social instability increases
- Ever-larger budgets required to maintain control
- **Diagnosis**: Coercive overhead (symptom of underlying brittleness)

**The classification emerges from empirical trajectories, not a priori theory.** We don't ask "what is policing's essential nature?" We ask "what measurable effects does this spending pattern have on systemic costs over time?"

**Why This Isn't Circular:**

The framework doesn't require theory-neutral definitions. It requires convergent evidence across independent metrics. When military spending correlates with falling mortality and rising innovation, it's productive. When it correlates with demographic decline and suppressed innovation while requiring escalating expenditure, it's coercive overhead.

The convergence of multiple independent indicators (demographic, economic, stability, innovation) provides robust diagnosis despite interpretive challenges in any single metric.
```

**Rationale:** Directly addresses circularity objection with operational protocol showing how classification emerges from empirical data patterns.

---

### ✅ **Task 5: Add Section 2.4.1 - Baseline Problem Resolution**

**Location:** Insert within Section 2.4 after the table of indicators, before "Coercion Ratio (C(t))" paragraph

**Action:** ADD NEW SUBSECTION

**Full text to insert:**

```markdown
#### 2.4.1 Addressing the Baseline Problem

Critics object that "excess mortality" requires theory-laden baselines. The framework employs three independent baselines whose convergence provides robust diagnosis without circularity:

**1. Comparative-Historical Baseline**: Compare mortality rates across contemporaneous societies with similar technology, resource availability, disease environments, and population density. A society with 50% child mortality when peers achieve 30% experiences measurable excess relative to its era's pragmatic constraints. This is empirically measurable without anachronism.

**2. Trajectory Analysis**: Track whether mortality is rising (system degrading), stable (system maintaining), or falling (system improving). When System A shows rising mortality while System B shows falling mortality under comparable conditions, we have empirical grounds for diagnosis without requiring absolute baselines.

**3. Demographic Viability Thresholds**: Some thresholds are biologically determinate: Total Fertility Rate < 2.1 = population decline (absent immigration); infant mortality > 30% = demographic stress; life expectancy < 30 = crisis conditions. These aren't normative judgments but structural constraints on population reproduction.

**Triangulation Methodology**: Don't rely on any single baseline. Diagnose "excess" through convergent evidence:
- Worse than contemporaneous peers? (+1 brittleness indicator)
- Deteriorating trajectory? (+1 brittleness indicator)
- Below biological viability thresholds? (+1 brittleness indicator)
- High coercive spending to manage mortality? (+1 brittleness indicator)

The diagnosis becomes robust through triangulation, not through finding a single theory-neutral measurement. This is how empirical science handles complex phenomena: no single test proves a theory, but convergence across independent experimental paradigms provides robust evidence.
```

**Rationale:** Shows how multiple independent baselines triangulate to robust diagnosis, directly addressing baseline circularity concerns.

---

### ✅ **Task 6: Revise Abstract**

**Location:** Abstract, final sentences

**Action:** REPLACE final sentences

**Delete:**
```
This naturalistic account redefines objective truth as alignment with the Apex Network, explains pragmatic revision in Quine's web of belief, and supports a falsifiable research program for assessing epistemic health.
```

**Replace with:**
```
This naturalistic account redefines objective truth as alignment with the Apex Network - not a pre-existing metaphysical blueprint but the necessary structure of optimal solutions determined by mind-independent pragmatic constraints. The framework explains pragmatic revision in Quine's web of belief, provides prospective guidance through constraint analysis, and supports a falsifiable research program for assessing epistemic health. Preliminary applications to cases like Ptolemaic astronomy and AI development illustrate the approach, using proxies such as citation patterns and resource metrics.
```

**Rationale:** Incorporates modal necessity language into abstract, clarifying what kind of objectivity is claimed.

---

### ✅ **Task 7: Add Section 7.6 - Scope, Limitations, and Bullets Bitten**

**Location:** Insert before Section 8 (Conclusion)

**Action:** ADD NEW SECTION

**Full text to insert:**

```markdown
### 7.6 Scope, Limitations, and Bullets Bitten

Intellectual honesty requires stating what this framework does NOT claim and which genuine costs it accepts.

**Acknowledged Limitations:**

1. **Species-Specific Objectivity**: Moral truths are objective for creatures with our biological and social architecture (extended childhood requiring cooperation, limited cognition requiring trust, biological constraints of mortality and suffering). Hypothetical beings with radically different structures would face different pragmatic constraints and discover different optimal configurations. This is relativism at the species level, not cultural level - analogous to how chemistry is objective within baryonic matter but might differ for exotic matter. We accept this as appropriate epistemic modesty: claims are grounded in actual evidence about actual systems, not speculation about hypothetical beings.

2. **Tragic Epistemology**: We learn moral truths primarily through catastrophic failure. The Negative Canon is written in blood. We couldn't know slavery's wrongness without the historical experiment generating centuries of suffering. Future moral knowledge requires future suffering to generate data. There is no shortcut bypassing human cost. We accept this as the price of empirical knowledge in complex domains - similar to how medical knowledge required harmful experiments before ethical review boards.

3. **Floor Not Ceiling**: The framework maps necessary constraints (the floor), not sufficient conditions for flourishing (the ceiling). It cannot address what makes life meaningful beyond sustainable, supererogatory virtue, or moral excellence vs. adequacy. It identifies catastrophic failures and boundary conditions, leaving substantial space for legitimate value pluralism. We accept this as appropriate scope limitation - the framework does what it does well rather than overreaching.

4. **Expert Dependence**: Accurate brittleness assessment requires technical expertise in historical analysis, statistics, comparative methods, and systems theory. This creates epistemic inequality - not everyone has equal access to moral knowledge. We accept this as similar to scientific expertise generally, while acknowledging it creates democratic legitimacy challenges requiring institutional solutions.

5. **Discovery Requires Experiment**: While the Apex Network exists as determined structure, discovering it requires empirical data. We cannot deduce optimal social configurations from first principles alone - we need historical experiments to reveal constraint topology. Constraint analysis provides prospective guidance but cannot fully replace empirical testing. We accept this as appropriate epistemic humility about complex systems.

**What We Claim**: These limitations don't undermine the framework's contribution - they define its appropriate scope. EPC excels at: identifying catastrophic failures, explaining moral progress, grounding realism naturalistically, providing empirical tools for institutional evaluation, and offering prospective guidance through constraint analysis. It's a powerful diagnostic tool for systemic health, not a complete ethics or theory of human flourishing.

The framework's value lies in what it does well, not in pretending to solve all philosophical problems. This honest accounting of scope strengthens rather than weakens its claims.
```

**Rationale:** Provides honest accounting of genuine limitations and bullets bitten, demonstrating intellectual rigor and appropriate modesty.

---

### ✅ **Task 8: Strengthen Section 4.1 - Negative Canon as Constraint Revelation**

**Location:** Section 4.1, after "The Negative Canon functions like a reef chart for inquiry" paragraph

**Action:** ADD paragraph

**Full text to insert:**

```markdown
**The Negative Canon as Constraint Revelation:**

The Negative Canon doesn't merely catalogue historical accidents - it reveals necessary features of the constraint landscape. When slavery generates catastrophic brittleness across maximally different societies (ancient Rome, Caribbean plantations, American South, Islamic caliphates, various African kingdoms), this isn't coincidence. It reveals a deep structural fact: systems organizing labor through chattel ownership violate fundamental constraints on viable human cooperation.

This is why the Canon provides prospective guidance, not merely retrospective classification. We can predict that any novel system sharing slavery's core structural features (treating humans as property, suppressing human capital, requiring massive coercive overhead) will generate high brittleness, even without running the specific experiment. The Canon maps constraint violations, not just historical failures.
```

**Rationale:** Shows how Negative Canon reveals necessary constraint structure, enabling prospective guidance.

---

### ✅ **Task 9: Expand Section 5.4 - Grounding Problem**

**Location:** Section 5.4 (currently in Appendix, needs to be moved to main body if not already), after the Instrumental Defense

**Action:** ADD new argument

**Note:** Section 5.4 doesn't currently exist in main body. This content should be added to Section 3.1 where grounding is discussed.

**Location for insertion:** After the Instrumental Argument in Section 3.1

**Full text to insert:**

```markdown
**The Transcendental-Modal Argument:**

The grounding goes deeper than instrumental. The constraint structure imposes a procedural-transcendental necessity:

For any normative system to become an object of sustained analysis, evaluation, or discourse, it must persist long enough to generate that discourse. This persistence is not guaranteed - most attempted systems fail. Those persisting do so by navigating pragmatic constraints with sufficient efficiency to avoid collapse. This is not a chosen value but an evolutionary filter operating whether we endorse it or not.

The Apex Network is the necessary structure of optimal navigation given these constraints. When we engage in normative discourse at all, we operate within a solution space bounded by these constraints. The "objectivity" is structural - an objective fact about which architectures can sustain the practice of inquiry itself.

**Analogy**: Architects don't "choose" to value buildings that resist gravity - that constraint is constitutive of architecture as a practice. You cannot coherently build while rejecting it. Similarly, communities cannot sustain normative discourse while maintaining predicates generating brittleness so extreme they destroy discourse conditions themselves.

The "ought" emerges from recognizing: if you engage in shared normative deliberation, you must operate within constraints making such deliberation sustainable. These constraints determine an optimal structure. Discovering and aligning with that structure is what moral inquiry consists in.
```

**Rationale:** Adds transcendental-modal argument showing why constraint-alignment isn't arbitrary preference but structural necessity.

---

### ✅ **Task 10: Revise Section 6.1 Final Paragraph**

**Location:** Section 6.1, final paragraph

**Action:** REPLACE final paragraph

**Delete:**
Current final paragraph starting "This dynamic, failure-driven approach..."

**Replace with:**
```markdown
This dynamic, failure-driven approach also distinguishes our model from much of network epistemology, which analyzes information flow within static structures (Zollman 2013; Rosenstock et al. 2017). By examining how entire networks evolve under selective pressure, and by grounding that pressure in a necessary constraint structure rather than contingent history, we provide what coherentism has lacked: an externalist check that explains both how the web's structure is forged and why that structure tracks objective features of reality. The Apex Network is not an arbitrary historical product but the optimal solution to the constraint problem all viable systems face.
```

**Rationale:** Emphasizes that Apex Network is optimal solution to constraint problem, not arbitrary historical product.

---

## **MINOR BUT IMPORTANT REVISIONS**

### ✅ **Task 11: Add Clarity to Introduction - Viability vs Endurance**

**Location:** Section 1, after paragraph "It serves as a macro-epistemology..."

**Action:** ADD clarifying paragraph

**Full text to insert:**

```markdown
A crucial distinction: the framework analyzes viability, not mere endurance. A brutal empire persisting through massive coercion exhibits high brittleness - its longevity measures the immense energy it burns managing self-inflicted instability. Viability measures efficiency and adaptive capacity, not temporal duration. This distinction is central to avoiding "might makes right" objections.
```

**Rationale:** Preempts misunderstanding that longevity = viability.

---

### ✅ **Task 12: Clarify Discovery vs Creation in Section 4.2**

**Location:** Section 4.2, paragraph beginning "The mechanism that forges this structure"

**Action:** REPLACE paragraph

**Delete:**
```
The mechanism that forges this structure is bottom-up emergence driven by the need for cross-domain consistency. Local Shared Networks, developed to solve specific problems, face pressure to cohere with one another in an interconnected world.
```

**Replace with:**
```markdown
The mechanism through which we discover this structure is bottom-up emergence driven by the need for cross-domain consistency. Local Shared Networks, developed to solve specific problems, face pressure to cohere with one another because they operate in an interconnected reality. This pressure creates tendency toward integration, though whether this results in a single maximally coherent system or stable pluralism remains an empirical question.

Crucially, this process reveals rather than creates the Apex Network. The convergence is toward an objective structure determined by constraints, not toward an arbitrary equilibrium selected by historical accident. Just as independent mathematical traditions converge on the same theorems when pursuing rigor, independent societies converge on similar low-brittleness principles when pursuing viability.
```

**Rationale:** Clarifies that emergence is discovery mechanism, not creation mechanism.

---

### ✅ **Task 13: Add to Glossary**

**Location:** Section 1, Glossary

**Action:** ADD two new entries

**Full text to insert:**

```markdown
- **Pragmatic Objectivity**: Objectivity sufficient for comparative assessment and institutional evaluation, achieved through convergent evidence across independent metrics, without requiring view-from-nowhere neutrality or complete theory-independence. The framework's claims are objective in being determined by mind-independent constraints, though our knowledge of those constraints remains fallible and requires empirical triangulation.

- **Modal Necessity (of Apex Network)**: The Apex Network exists as a necessary structure determined by pragmatic constraints, not as a contingent product of which societies happened to survive. It would be discovered through any sufficiently comprehensive exploration of the constraint landscape, making it counterfactually stable across alternative histories.
```

**Rationale:** Provides clear definitions of key technical concepts introduced in revisions.

---

### ✅ **Task 14: Strengthen Introduction Paragraph on Naturalized Proceduralism**

**Location:** Section 1, paragraph beginning "This paper develops Emergent Pragmatic Coherentism..."

**Action:** Enhance the constraint language

**Current text includes:** "The final arbiter is not the internal coherence of our reasons, but the measurable brittleness of the systems those reasons produce—a procedure disciplined by the non-discursive data of systemic success and failure."

**Add after this sentence:**
```markdown
The Apex Network represents not what happened to survive but what must survive given the constraint structure of reality - a mind-independent topology of viability that historical filtering reveals rather than creates.
```

**Rationale:** Introduces modal necessity claim early in paper.

---

### ✅ **Task 15: Add Prospective Guidance Emphasis to Section 4.1**

**Location:** Section 4.1, in the bullet points listing failures

**Action:** ADD clarifying sentence after the bullet points

**After this text:**
```
* **Failures of Normative Alignment** are characteristic of *Normative Brittleness*. Systems like chattel slavery or totalitarianism entered the canon because their core principles violated emergent normative facts about human cooperation.
```

**Insert:**
```markdown
These catalogued failures do more than record history - they map the constraint topology itself. By identifying structural features that reliably generate brittleness across contexts (e.g., treating humans as property, suppressing information flow, concentrating unchecked power), the Canon enables prospective diagnosis of novel systems exhibiting similar patterns.
```

**Rationale:** Emphasizes prospective guidance capacity derived from constraint mapping.

---

## **THEMATIC CONSISTENCY CHECKS**

### ✅ **Task 16: Global Search-and-Strengthen "Constraint-Determined" Language**

**Action:** Review and enhance language throughout paper

**Pattern to establish:**
- When discussing Apex Network → emphasize "determined by constraints"
- When discussing convergence → emphasize "discovering necessary structure"
- When discussing historical filtering → emphasize "reveals rather than creates"

**Specific locations to enhance:**

1. **Section 4.2 opening** - Already addressed in Task 12
2. **Section 4.3 truth levels** - Already addressed in Task 2
3. **Abstract** - Already addressed in Task 6

**Additional location:**

**Section 8 Conclusion, second paragraph**

**Current:** "This naturalistic account redefines truth as alignment with the emergent Apex Network, forged by historical filtering."

**Revise to:** "This naturalistic account redefines truth as alignment with the Apex Network - the necessary structure of optimal solutions determined by pragmatic constraints, revealed through historical filtering."

## **KEY CONCEPTUAL ACHIEVEMENTS**

These revisions accomplish:

1. **Establishes modal/necessity claim**: Apex Network as determined structure, not historical accident
2. **Resolves circularity objections**: Through causal hierarchy and triangulation methodology
3. **Strengthens mathematics treatment**: From limitation to paradigm case
4. **Adds prospective guidance**: Shows how constraint analysis enables prediction
5. **Honest limitations accounting**: Section 7.6 demonstrates intellectual rigor
6. **Maintains naturalism**: All claims remain empirically grounded
7. **Enhances falsifiability**: Clearer empirical commitments throughout

---

## **PHILOSOPHICAL POSITIONING SUMMARY**

**The revised paper claims:**

- **Objectivity type**: Procedural-modal objectivity (determined by constraints, discovered through history)
- **Apex Network status**: Necessary structure (like mathematical truths) not contingent product
- **Counterfactual stability**: Same structure would be discovered in alternative histories
- **Prospective capacity**: Can analyze constraint space, not just retrospective history
- **Scope honesty**: Clear about species-specificity, tragic epistemology, floor-not-ceiling

**What distinguishes this from competitors:**

- **vs. Platonic realism**: No pre-existing metaphysical blueprint, emergent from pragmatic process
- **vs. Social constructivism**: Mind-independent constraints determine structure
- **vs. Pure empiricism**: Modal necessity claims about constraint space
- **vs. A priori rationalism**: Discovered through historical filtering, not deduced

This is **naturalized modal realism** about normative structure.

---
