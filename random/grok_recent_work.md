### 1.2 Engagement with Contemporary Scholarship

Recent developments in epistemology have enriched coherentist approaches by emphasizing dynamic, emergent, and context-sensitive dimensions of justification. Emergent Pragmatic Coherentism (EPC) aligns with and extends these contributions, particularly in its treatment of coherence as a viable structure shaped by pragmatic constraints. While EPC draws primarily from established naturalized traditions, such as Quine's holism and Kitcher's evolutionary model, it finds productive parallels in contemporary frameworks that address similar tensions, including the isolation objection. Here, I briefly engage with selected recent works to situate EPC within ongoing discussions, highlighting points of convergence and departure without claiming to resolve perennial debates.

Ayvazov's phase epistemology (2025a, 2025b) offers a resonance-based model of knowledge, where justification emerges from structural alignments rather than static probabilistic coherence or foundational certainties. In this view, epistemic states transition through phases of uncertainty, achieving stability via mutual vector adjustments that reflect environmental responses. EPC shares this emphasis on emergence: just as Ayvazov's epistemic vectors converge on resonant configurations through iterative feedback, EPC posits that knowledge systems evolve toward the Apex Network by minimizing brittleness under pragmatic pushback. However, EPC departs by operationalizing this process through measurable systemic costs, such as conceptual debt, providing a diagnostic lens that complements Ayvazov's more abstract phase transitions. This alignment strengthens EPC's response to the isolation objection; a system detached from constraints would fail to achieve resonance or viability, as both frameworks imply necessary convergence on mind-independent structures. One potential objection—that phase epistemology risks overemphasizing subjective resonance at the expense of objective constraints—is preempted in EPC by grounding emergence in demonstrated historical filtering, ensuring that viability serves as a non-arbitrary external check.

Harvey's lifeworld coherentism (2024) provides another relevant extension, proposing a Husserlian-inspired framework where empirical beliefs are justified through coherent integration within tradition-based perspectival horizons. This approach argues for coherentism's doxastic plausibility over foundationalism, particularly in handling introspective accessibility and noetic structure. EPC resonates with this by treating shared networks as public architectures that emerge from individual webs aligned under pragmatic pressure, much like Harvey's perspectivalism accommodates justificatory roles for context-embedded beliefs. Where Harvey focuses on first- and second-order justification for empirical claims, EPC broadens this to macro-level systems in cumulative domains like science, using brittleness indicators to assess long-term health. This integration helps address reviewer concerns about EPC's scope: while not a solution for basic perception or Gettier cases, it offers macro-foundations that could inform higher-order evidence, aligning with Harvey's emphasis on coherentism's flexibility without overreaching into unrelated epistemic puzzles.

In the domain of moral epistemology, Muntean's moral coherentism (2025) explores artificial moral learning as a two-dimensional coherent system, dividing data into factual and valuational subspaces with machine-learnable patterns. This framework sheds light on meta-ethical coherentism by modeling concordance across dimensions, relevant to EPC's application in AI development (as illustrated in Section 2.3). EPC extends this by viewing AI paradigms as knowledge networks susceptible to brittleness, such as escalating model complexity for marginal gains. A key convergence lies in both approaches' recognition of emergent patterns: Muntean's subspaces mirror EPC's nested networks, where viability emerges from constraint satisfaction rather than isolated components. Yet EPC qualifies this optimism by highlighting pragmatic pushback in abstract domains, where inefficiencies signal fragility even absent direct falsification. This engagement preempts objections that EPC neglects normative extensions; by incorporating insights from moral coherentism, it suggests avenues for applying brittleness diagnostics to ethical AI, though such applications remain provisional pending further interdisciplinary work.

Swiderski's varieties of metaphysical coherentism (2024) further informs EPC's ontological commitments, articulating interconnected grounding relations as a viable alternative to hierarchical foundationalism. While primarily metaphysical, this work's exploration of symmetric dependence networks parallels EPC's depiction of the Apex Network as an emergent structure revealed through failure elimination, not pre-existing hierarchy. EPC departs by naturalizing this in epistemic terms, emphasizing pragmatic viability over pure metaphysical coherence, which helps mitigate concerns about vicious cycles or isolation—unstable configurations are filtered out historically, yielding counterfactually stable truths.

These engagements demonstrate EPC's compatibility with contemporary scholarship, offering a framework that builds on emergent and contextual insights while maintaining focus on pragmatic diagnostics. Importantly, EPC does not claim superiority but proposes a complementary tool for assessing epistemic health in cumulative systems. Future work could test these alignments more rigorously, perhaps through comparative analyses of brittleness in phase-based or lifeworld models.
