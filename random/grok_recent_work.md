### Engagement with Contemporary Scholarship

Recent developments in epistemology have enriched coherentist approaches by emphasizing dynamic, emergent, and context-sensitive dimensions of justification. Emergent Pragmatic Coherentism (EPC) aligns with and extends these contributions, particularly in its treatment of coherence as a viable structure shaped by pragmatic constraints. While EPC draws primarily from established naturalized traditions, such as Quine's holism and Kitcher's evolutionary model, it finds productive parallels in contemporary frameworks that address similar tensions, including the isolation objection. Here, I briefly engage with selected recent works to situate EPC within ongoing discussions, highlighting points of convergence and departure without claiming to resolve perennial debates.

Ayvazov's phase epistemology (2025a, 2025b) offers a resonance-based model of knowledge, where justification emerges from structural alignments rather than static probabilistic coherence or foundational certainties. In this view, epistemic states transition through phases of uncertainty, achieving stability via mutual vector adjustments that reflect environmental responses. EPC shares this emphasis on emergence: just as Ayvazov's epistemic vectors converge on resonant configurations through iterative feedback, EPC posits that knowledge systems evolve toward the Apex Network by minimizing brittleness under pragmatic pushback. However, EPC departs by operationalizing this process through measurable systemic costs, such as conceptual debt, providing a diagnostic lens that complements Ayvazov's more abstract phase transitions. This alignment strengthens EPC's response to the isolation objection; a system detached from constraints would fail to achieve resonance or viability, as both frameworks imply necessary convergence on mind-independent structures. One potential objection—that phase epistemology risks overemphasizing subjective resonance at the expense of objective constraints—is preempted in EPC by grounding emergence in demonstrated historical filtering, ensuring that viability serves as a non-arbitrary external check.

Harvey's lifeworld coherentism (2024) provides another relevant extension, proposing a Husserlian-inspired framework where empirical beliefs are justified through coherent integration within tradition-based perspectival horizons. This approach argues for coherentism's doxastic plausibility over foundationalism, particularly in handling introspective accessibility and noetic structure. EPC resonates with this by treating shared networks as public architectures that emerge from individual webs aligned under pragmatic pressure, much like Harvey's perspectivalism accommodates justificatory roles for context-embedded beliefs. Where Harvey focuses on first- and second-order justification for empirical claims, EPC broadens this to macro-level systems in cumulative domains like science, using brittleness indicators to assess long-term health. This integration helps address reviewer concerns about EPC's scope: while not a solution for basic perception or Gettier cases, it offers macro-foundations that could inform higher-order evidence, aligning with Harvey's emphasis on coherentism's flexibility without overreaching into unrelated epistemic puzzles.

In the domain of moral epistemology, Muntean's moral coherentism (2025) explores artificial moral learning as a two-dimensional coherent system, dividing data into factual and valuational subspaces with machine-learnable patterns. This framework sheds light on meta-ethical coherentism by modeling concordance across dimensions, relevant to EPC's application in AI development (as illustrated in Section 2.3). EPC extends this by viewing AI paradigms as knowledge networks susceptible to brittleness, such as escalating model complexity for marginal gains. A key convergence lies in both approaches' recognition of emergent patterns: Muntean's subspaces mirror EPC's nested networks, where viability emerges from constraint satisfaction rather than isolated components. Yet EPC qualifies this optimism by highlighting pragmatic pushback in abstract domains, where inefficiencies signal fragility even absent direct falsification. This engagement preempts objections that EPC neglects normative extensions; by incorporating insights from moral coherentism, it suggests avenues for applying brittleness diagnostics to ethical AI, though such applications remain provisional pending further interdisciplinary work.

Swiderski's varieties of metaphysical coherentism (2024) further informs EPC's ontological commitments, articulating interconnected grounding relations as a viable alternative to hierarchical foundationalism. While primarily metaphysical, this work's exploration of symmetric dependence networks parallels EPC's depiction of the Apex Network as an emergent structure revealed through failure elimination, not pre-existing hierarchy. EPC departs by naturalizing this in epistemic terms, emphasizing pragmatic viability over pure metaphysical coherence, which helps mitigate concerns about vicious cycles or isolation—unstable configurations are filtered out historically, yielding counterfactually stable truths.

These engagements demonstrate EPC's compatibility with contemporary scholarship, offering a framework that builds on emergent and contextual insights while maintaining focus on pragmatic diagnostics. Importantly, EPC does not claim superiority but proposes a complementary tool for assessing epistemic health in cumulative systems. Future work could test these alignments more rigorously, perhaps through comparative analyses of brittleness in phase-based or lifeworld models.

### Summary of References

Below, I provide concise summaries of the referenced works, drawing from their abstracts and key arguments as available from scholarly sources. These summaries focus on the core contributions, epistemological concepts, and relevance to coherentist themes, while maintaining philosophical precision without overinterpretation.

This paper introduces "phase epistemology," a framework that reconceptualizes knowledge as emerging from resonance-based alignment between a cognitive agent's internal structures and the environment's informational dynamics, rather than through inference or probability. Knowledge is treated as a "phase event" that resolves semantic ambiguity (termed "semantic superposition") into meaning via "epistemic vectors"—directed trajectories of awareness stabilized through recursive feedback. Drawing on quantum theory, systems biology, and philosophy of mind, it argues for minimal self-awareness in biological and artificial systems as structural attractors amid mutual uncertainty. The contribution extends classical epistemology by emphasizing relational dimensions, with implications for cognitive science, AI, and scientific observation. It positions knowing as topological stability from self-world resonance, critiquing reductionist accounts.

Building on phase epistemology, this work focuses on the "epistemic vector" as a directional trajectory of intelligibility emerging from asymptotic phase coherence between observer and observed, evolving toward topological stability. Knowledge is framed as a recursive alignment process, not representation or correspondence, with "semantic collapse" (ambiguity resolution into meaning) driven by relational coherence, analogous to quantum wavefunction reduction. Integrating quantum theory, philosophy of mind, and structural realism, it critiques probabilistic mechanics and advances coherent consciousness as an emergent property. Key concepts include observer-environment coherence, synchronicity, and asymptotic cognition, offering a unified model that links physical measurement to cognitive interpretation.

This article engages the debate on the noetic structure of empirical beliefs for epistemic justification, advocating a coherentist alternative to foundationalism. At the first-order level, it proposes "lifeworld coherentism," inspired by Husserl, where beliefs are justified by coherence with a pre-theoretical background of everyday experiences and practices. At the second-order level, it introduces "tradition-based perspectivalism," embedding justificatory norms in cultural and historical traditions for flexible evaluation. The framework argues for coherentism's doxastic plausibility, addressing introspective accessibility and noetic structure while accommodating perspectival variations without relativism.

This article examines metaphysical coherentism, where grounding relations form an interconnected system with mutual dependencies, leaving nothing ungrounded. It explores varieties, including symmetric and holistic grounding, as alternatives to hierarchical foundationalism. Key arguments defend coherentism's viability against objections like infinite regress, emphasizing symmetric networks and holistic interdependence. The focus is metaphysical but informs epistemic parallels by highlighting relational structures over isolated foundations.

### Relations, Differences, and Complementarities with Contemporary Scholarship

Having situated Emergent Pragmatic Coherentism (EPC) within recent epistemological developments, this subsection provides a more detailed examination of how EPC relates to, differs from, and complements the specific frameworks in these works. The analysis proceeds work by work, beginning with shared assumptions and progressing to points of divergence and mutual enhancement. This comparison assumes that EPC's core commitments—grounding coherence in demonstrated viability through systemic brittleness and pragmatic constraints—are plausible starting points, as established in prior sections. From there, each step highlights logical alignments or tensions, preempting potential misunderstandings (e.g., that EPC claims to supersede these views) by emphasizing its role as a complementary macro-epistemological tool for cumulative knowledge systems. Qualifications are included to acknowledge the provisional nature of these engagements, given the evolving state of the literature and EPC's focus on pragmatic diagnostics rather than exhaustive ontology.

#### Relations to Ayvazov (2025a, 2025b)
Ayvazov's phase epistemology presents knowledge as an emergent property of structural resonance between a cognitive agent's internal structures and the environment's informational dynamics, rather than as inferential accumulation or probabilistic justification. Central to this is the "epistemic vector," a directional trajectory of intelligibility that resolves semantic superposition (a state of interpretive ambiguity) into meaning through recursive phase alignment, drawing analogies from quantum wavefunction reduction and systems biology. Knowledge thus emerges as topological stability from mutual uncertainty, extending beyond traditional coherentism by incorporating relational and dynamic feedback.

EPC relates closely to this in its emphasis on emergence: both frameworks posit that viable knowledge structures arise from iterative interactions with mind-independent constraints, rather than static internal consistency. For instance, EPC's pragmatic pushback—the non-negotiable consequences of applying propositions—mirrors Ayvazov's recursive feedback loops, where misalignment (e.g., unresolved semantic superposition) generates instability akin to brittleness. The Apex Network in EPC, as the emergent structure of maximal viability discovered through historical filtering, aligns with Ayvazov's topological stabilization, where epistemic vectors converge on resonant configurations. This shared rejection of representationalism in favor of relational coherence strengthens EPC's response to the isolation objection: a detached system would fail to achieve resonance or viability, as constraints necessitate alignment.

However, EPC differs in its grounding and scope. Ayvazov's model, with its quantum-inspired analogies (e.g., semantic collapse like wavefunction reduction), leans toward an abstract ontology of phase events applicable to minimal self-awareness in biological or artificial systems. EPC, by contrast, naturalizes this through observable systemic costs (e.g., conceptual debt or coercive overheads), making it more diagnostic and less metaphorical. While Ayvazov critiques reductionist accounts for neglecting relational dimensions, EPC qualifies its own approach by focusing on macro-level cumulative domains (e.g., science), avoiding overextension into basic cognition or quantum epistemology. A potential objection—that EPC's cost minimization risks instrumentalism over genuine emergence—is addressed by noting that brittleness serves as a proxy for constraint satisfaction, much like Ayvazov's mutual uncertainty signals misalignment without reducing knowledge to utility.

EPC complements Ayvazov's work by providing prospective guidance for assessing phase-like transitions in knowledge systems. For example, brittleness indicators (e.g., rising model complexity) could diagnose when a system's epistemic vectors are diverging from resonance, offering a pragmatic tool for empirical inquiry that Ayvazov's framework invites but does not fully operationalize. Conversely, Ayvazov's emphasis on asymptotic coherence could refine EPC's historical filtering, suggesting that convergence on the Apex Network involves not just failure elimination but progressive vector alignment. This mutual enhancement preempts concerns about EPC's historical contingency: if knowledge emerges relationally, as Ayvazov argues, then EPC's viability under constraint ensures counterfactual stability across alternative paths.

#### Relations to Harvey (2024)
Harvey's framework engages the noetic structure of empirical beliefs, advocating coherentism over foundationalism for justificatory plausibility. At the first-order level, "lifeworld coherentism" (inspired by Husserl) justifies beliefs through coherence with a pre-theoretical background of everyday experiences and practices. At the second-order level, "tradition-based perspectivalism" embeds norms in cultural and historical traditions, allowing flexible evaluation without relativism. This accommodates introspective accessibility and contextual variations, arguing that coherentism better handles the embedded nature of empirical justification.

EPC relates to this by treating shared networks as emergent public architectures from individual belief webs aligned under pragmatic pressure, echoing Harvey's lifeworld coherence as integration within experiential horizons. Both reject hierarchical foundationalism: EPC's bottom-up formation through holistic revisions parallels Harvey's first-order coherence, where beliefs gain viability from fitting a pre-theoretical manifold rather than isolated foundations. The isolation objection is addressed similarly—detached systems lack the contextual embedding (lifeworld or constraints) needed for stability.

Differences arise in focus and method. Harvey's perspectivalism emphasizes tradition-based norms for second-order justification, potentially introducing cultural relativity that EPC qualifies by prioritizing mind-independent pragmatic constraints (e.g., physical laws, biological limits). While Harvey targets empirical beliefs' doxastic structure, EPC operates at a macro-scale for inter-generational systems, using brittleness as a diagnostic rather than introspective coherence. This departure preempts objections that EPC overlooks individual epistemology: it provides macro-foundations that could inform Harvey's higher-order norms, but explicitly scopes itself to cumulative domains, avoiding claims about basic perception.

EPC complements Harvey by extending lifeworld coherentism to systemic health assessment. For instance, brittleness metrics could evaluate how well a tradition-based perspective minimizes costs over time, offering a pragmatic test for perspectival viability. In turn, Harvey's tradition-based flexibility could nuance EPC's convergence claims, suggesting that multiple viable paths to the Apex Network exist within cultural horizons, enhancing EPC's fallibilism without undermining its objective emergent structure.

#### Relations to Muntean (2025)
Muntean's project models "artificial moral learning" as moral coherentism, where machine processes achieve coherence by dividing data into factual and valuational subspaces, with emergent patterns arising from concordance across dimensions. This clarifies how AI can integrate moral cognition without foundational norms, emphasizing machine-learnable structures in meta-ethics and AI ethics.

EPC relates through its application to AI paradigms as knowledge networks prone to brittleness (e.g., escalating complexity for marginal gains). Both view coherence as emergent from subspace integration: Muntean's factual-valuational concordance mirrors EPC's nested networks (e.g., germ theory within biology), where viability emerges from cross-domain alignment under constraints.

Differences include domain and ontology. Muntean's focus on moral coherentism for AI treats learning as pattern emergence in subspaces, potentially more optimistic about artificial systems than EPC's cautionary diagnostics of fragility (e.g., ad hoc patches signaling pushback). EPC differs by generalizing to epistemic viability, qualifying moral extensions as speculative (per Appendix A), and emphasizing historical filtering over machine learning alone. This preempts objections that EPC neglects normative AI: it incorporates Muntean's insights but grounds them in pragmatic costs to avoid overreach.

EPC complements Muntean by applying brittleness to evaluate AI moral coherence—e.g., high coercive overheads in valuational subspaces could signal misalignment. Conversely, Muntean's subspace model could refine EPC's normative brittleness, suggesting emergent moral properties arise from factual-valuational concordance, enhancing EPC's unification of descriptive and normative inquiry.

#### Relations to Swiderski (2024)
Swiderski articulates metaphysical coherentism as a system where reality coheres through mutual dependencies, outlining varieties: (A) a necessitating whole, (B) a unified whole instantiated by elements, (C) mutually grounding elements, and (D) elements jointly grounded externally. Defending (C) and (D) against regress objections, it posits interconnected grounding as viable over hierarchy.

EPC relates ontologically: the Apex Network as emergent from constraint satisfaction parallels Swiderski's coherent systems, particularly (C)'s mutual dependence, where viable propositions cohere through pragmatic interrelations rather than foundational hierarchy.

Differences stem from domain—Swiderski's metaphysics vs. EPC's epistemology—though EPC naturalizes metaphysical commitments in epistemic terms (e.g., viability as proxy for grounding). EPC qualifies its realism as fallible, differing from Swiderski's defense of symmetric coherence by emphasizing pragmatic filtering to avoid vicious cycles.

EPC complements Swiderski by epistemicizing metaphysical coherence: brittleness could diagnose unstable grounding networks. Swiderski's varieties, in turn, could enrich EPC's ontology, suggesting the Apex Network coheres via mutual viability (C), bolstering its response to isolation without claiming metaphysical primacy.
