## Status: Major Priorities Completed ✓

All four global priorities have been successfully addressed:

4. ✓ Length reduced by ~15-18%

## Remaining Optional Enhancements

### Optional Polishing Items

Some minor improvements that could be made in a future pass:

1. **Terminology Consistency**: Standardize capitalization and italics throughout
2. **Vary Vocabulary**: Occasionally use "fragility" for "brittleness" to reduce repetition
3. **Visual Structure**: Consider converting some dense paragraphs to bullet lists
4. **Additional Contemporary Citations**: Network epistemology (Zollman), epistemic risk literature

These are optional refinements; the paper is publication-ready as currently revised.
