### 1. Proposition

### The Paper's Definition: "The Public Claim"

In "Convergent Coherence," a proposition is the first step in making knowledge public. It is a **falsifiable, testable claim, articulated in language, that is subject to collective assessment.** It is the public expression of a private belief.

- **Role:** The raw material of inquiry; the candidate for justification; the "data-to-be-tested."
- **Example:** The statement "Cholera is an infectious disease" starts as a propositionâ€”a specific hypothesis to be confirmed or refuted by evidence and pragmatic outcomes.

### The Computer Science / Formal Logic Definition: "The Grounded Statement"

In CS, a proposition is a complete, declarative statement that has a definite truth value (either True or False). It contains **no free variables**.

- **Role:** The basic unit of logic that can be evaluated.
- **Example:** `7 > 3` (a true proposition); `is_prime(8)` (a false proposition).

### The Philosophy Definition: "The Abstract Meaning"

In philosophy, a proposition is the **abstract, language-independent content** of a sentence. It is the fundamental "bearer" of truth and falsity and the object of belief.

- **Role:** The metaphysical entity that connects language and belief to reality.
- **Example:** The English sentence "It is raining" and the French sentence "Il pleut" are different sentences, but they express the same single proposition.

### Compare & Contrast

- **Paper vs. CS:** The paper's definition is very close to the CS one in function. Both treat it as a concrete, evaluable statement. However, the paper gives it an *epistemological context*: it's a claim *made by agents in a network*.
- **Paper vs. Philosophy:** The paper's definition is deliberately **deflationary**. It sidesteps the deep metaphysical questions philosophers ask (e.g., "What kind of object is a proposition?"). The author is only concerned with its functional role as a public claim that can be tested, not its abstract nature.

### 2. Predicate

### The Paper's Definition: "The Functional Core"

The paper identifies a predicate as the **reusable, functional component within a proposition** that attributes a property or relation.

- **Role:** The structural part of a claim that can be extracted and generalized.
- **Example:** In the proposition "Cholera is an infectious disease," the predicate is `...is an infectious disease`.

### The Computer Science / Formal Logic Definition: "The Boolean Function"

In CS, a predicate is a statement with one or more variables that becomes a proposition when its variables are filled. It's effectively a **function that returns a boolean**.

- **Role:** A template for a proposition; a way to define properties or relations over variables.
- **Example:** `is_prime(x)`; `GreaterThan(x, y)`.

### The Philosophy Definition: "The Property or Relation"

In philosophy, a predicate corresponds to the **property or relation** being attributed to a subject.

- **Role:** The part of a proposition that describes or relates the subjects.
- **Example:** In "Socrates is wise," the predicate "is wise" corresponds to the abstract property of wisdom.

### Compare & Contrast

- **All three are very similar:** All three domains use "predicate" to mean a template that defines a property or relation and is not yet a complete, evaluable statement. They all see it as the "open" part of a claim.
- The paper's key move is not in *redefining* predicate, but in giving it a dynamic history and a future role in its theory.

### 3. Standing Predicate

### The Paper's Definition: "The Public Tool"

This is the paper's central, novel concept. A Standing Predicate is a predicate whose parent proposition has been so overwhelmingly successful in reducing "systemic brittleness" that it gets **promoted from "tested-data" to a "tool-that-tests."**

- **Role:** A trusted, action-guiding, conceptual tool that forms the core architecture of a knowledge network. It is the functional "gene" of cultural evolution.
- **Example:** `...is an infectious disease` is a Standing Predicate in modern medicine. When a new illness appears, this tool is immediately applied, unpacking a vast network of proven methods.

### The Computer Science / Formal Logic Definition: (No Direct Equivalent)

CS and logic do not have a concept for a predicate that has earned a special epistemic status. The closest analogy would be a highly trusted, fundamental function in a standard library (e.g., `equals()`, `add()`), but this is a weak analogy as it lacks the paper's evolutionary and fallibilist story.

### The Philosophy Definition: (No Direct Equivalent)

Philosophy has related concepts, but they are different. A Standing Predicate is similar to:

- **A Kuhnian "paradigm"**: But it's a smaller unit and is justified by pragmatic costs, not just puzzle-solving ability.
- **A Lakatosian "hard core" principle**: But the paper provides a specific mechanism (reducing systemic costs) for how a principle becomes part of the core.
- **A Kantian "a priori category"**: But it is not a fixed structure of the mind; it is a *contingent, historical achievement* that is fallible and can be overturned.

### Compare & Contrast

- The Standing Predicate is the paper's unique synthesis. It takes the formal structure of a predicate and embeds it in an **evolutionary, pragmatic, and historical framework**. Its status is not logical (like in CS) or metaphysical (like in philosophy), but **epistemological and functional**. It is a tool whose authority comes from its proven track record.
