# **Convergent Coherence: A Pragmatic, Externalist Account of Objectivity**

## **Abstract**

Coherentist theories of justification remain vulnerable to the classic isolation objection: a belief system could be internally consistent yet detached from reality. This paper develops a framework to resolve this objection by grounding coherence in an externalist, pragmatic condition. We argue that the justification of a belief system depends on its demonstrated long-term viability, which can be analyzed through its "systemic brittleness"—a measure of the observable costs a system generates when its principles are applied. We posit that persistent, mind-independent pragmatic constraints create a selective pressure that filters out high-cost, brittle systems. This historical, eliminative process forces our fallible knowledge systems to converge on an emergent structure of viable principles. A proposition's justification, on this account, requires both its coherence within a collective knowledge system and the demonstrated resilience of that system against pragmatic consequences. This form of systemic externalism offers a naturalistic explanation for objectivity, where truth is understood as alignment with this emergent structure of viability. The framework provides a dynamic account of revision for Quine's web of belief and clarifies how a fallibilist and anti-foundationalist epistemology can be robustly realist.

## **1. Introduction: From a Static Web to a Dynamic Process**

Why did germ theory replace miasma theory? While a standard answer points to superior evidence, a deeper analysis reveals a story about systemic viability. Although miasma theory's focus on sanitation had some positive public health effects, its core principles were degenerating. The miasma network was demonstrably brittle: it generated significant real-world costs—thousands died in London because public health efforts were misdirected at odors—and it required an accelerating number of ad hoc patches to explain anomalies, such as why the "bad air" was only deadly near a specific water pump. The germ theory network, by contrast, proved vastly more resilient and adaptive. It dramatically reduced these costs by enabling effective interventions and explained a wide range of phenomena with a single conceptual tool.

This historical dynamic illustrates a persistent challenge for coherentist theories of justification: the isolation objection. As Laurence BonJour (1985) influentially argued, a belief system could achieve perfect internal consistency while remaining entirely detached from reality, a problem that purely internalist resources seem unable to resolve. While some coherentists have developed sophisticated internalist responses (Olsson 2005; Kvanvig 2012), the need for a robust external constraint remains a central problem for post-Quinean epistemology. This paper proposes such a constraint, but one that is pragmatic and historical rather than foundationalist. We will argue that the coherence of a knowledge system is disciplined by its long-term viability, a property that can be assessed through the observable, real-world costs generated when its principles are applied. This approach offers an externalist check that preserves coherentism's holistic insights.

This paper models inquiry as an evolutionary process aimed at cultivating viable, less fragile public knowledge systems. It is a macro-epistemology: a theory about the long-term viability of cumulative systems like science and law. To pre-empt a common misinterpretation, we distinguish viability from mere endurance. A brutal empire that persists through coercion is not viable in these terms but a textbook case of high brittleness; its longevity measures the immense energy it wastes suppressing its own instability. Viability is therefore not an intrinsic property but a relational one: a system's capacity to solve problems within a given pragmatic environment with sustainably low systemic costs.

However, any credible theory of knowledge evolution must account for the realities of power, path dependence, and historical contingency. This framework incorporates these factors not as exceptions but as key variables within the model. The exercise of power to maintain a brittle system is not a refutation of the model but a primary indicator of that system's non-viability, measured through its high coercive costs. This failure-driven, adaptive process grounds a robust but fallible realism. It explains how our evolving knowledge systems are forced to converge on an emergent structure of workable solutions determined by mind-independent pragmatic constraints. The claim is probabilistic, not deterministic: beneath the surface noise of contingency and power, there are underlying structural pressures at work. A system accumulating brittleness is not fated to collapse on a specific date, but it becomes progressively more vulnerable to the very contingent shocks that historians study. This model does not offer a deterministic theory of history but rather proposes the foundation for a falsifiable, probabilistic research program for understanding the structural dynamics that shape the landscape upon which historical events unfold.

The argument proceeds as a systematic construction in seven steps. Section 2 introduces the diagnostic framework for assessing systemic viability through brittleness indicators. Section 3 develops the logic of systemic viability. Section 4 presents the Apex Network as an emergent necessary structure, articulating the modal claims that ground naturalistic objectivity. Section 5 explains how this evolutionary process animates Quine's web of belief. Section 6 situates Systemic Externalism within contemporary epistemology. Section 7 defends the framework against key objections while acknowledging its principled limitations.

## **2. A Framework for Assessing Systemic Viability**

To understand how some knowledge systems evolve and thrive while others stagnate and collapse, we need a way to assess their structural health. A naturalistic theory requires functional, precise tools for this analysis, moving beyond mere internal consistency to gauge a system's resilience against real-world pressures. In this, our approach shares a deep affinity with the diagnostic ethos of complex systems theory (Meadows 2008). This section develops such a framework by tracing how a private belief becomes a public, functional component of a knowledge system.

### **2.1 Forging the Instruments: From Private Belief to Public Tool**

Following standard practice in naturalized epistemology (Goldman 1979; Kitcher 1993), this framework shifts focus from private psychological states to public, functional structures. This methodological move makes the analysis tractable by focusing on observable phenomena and addresses epistemic systems that transcend individual cognition.

**The Deflationary Path: Belief → Proposition → Validated Data → Standing Predicate**

#### **2.1.1 From Private Belief to Public Proposition**

The journey begins with belief, the raw material of epistemology. As a private psychological state, it is analytically inaccessible for a theory of public knowledge. The first step is to isolate its testable, public content as a proposition: a falsifiable claim articulated in language, subject to collective assessment.

#### **2.1.2 The Coherence Test**

Next, a candidate proposition must pass a rigorous test for coherence. This is not the thin, formal consistency of logic but a thick, forward-looking pragmatic assessment: a form of risk analysis. A shared network, as a resource-constrained system, implicitly asks whether integrating this proposition will increase or decrease its long-term systemic brittleness. A proposition that successfully passes this test is accepted into the network as validated data.

#### **2.1.3 From Validated Data to Standing Predicate**

Finally, propositions that not only pass the coherence test but do so with exceptional success by dramatically reducing a network's systemic costs undergo a profound status change. This promotion from data to a trusted, evaluative tool is a crucial step in a network's ability to learn and represents a distinct functional status. To capture this status, we will refer to such a promoted conceptual tool as a **Standing Predicate**. A Standing Predicate is the reusable, action-guiding conceptual tool within a proposition that has earned a durable, trusted status. It is the functional "gene" of cultural evolution. For example, once "Cholera is an infectious disease" proved its immense pragmatic value, its functional component—the predicate `...is an infectious disease`—was promoted. Its authority comes from its proven history of enabling successful action. This Standing Predicate now functions as a durable piece of conceptual technology. Applying it to a new phenomenon activates a rich sub-network of proven diagnostic heuristics and licensed inferences. The original proposition has transitioned from *being-tested* data to a *tool-that-tests*.

### **2.2 The Units of Analysis: Predicates, Networks, and Replicators**

*   **Standing Predicate:** This is the primary unit of cultural-epistemic selection: the validated, reusable, and action-guiding conceptual tool within a proposition. When applied, it unpacks a suite of previously validated knowledge.
*   **Shared Network:** An observable consequence of Quine's holism applied socially. A Shared Network is the emergent, public architecture formed by the coherent subset of propositions and predicates that must be shared across many individual webs of belief for agents to solve problems collectively. These networks are often nested (e.g., germ theory within medicine).

To be precise about this evolutionary dynamic, we can adopt a distinction from generalized evolutionary theory (Mesoudi 2011). The network’s abstract informational structure functions as the **replicator**: the "code" that is copied. The social group and its institutions function as the **interactor**: the physical "vessel" through which this code is expressed and tested.

### **2.3 Pragmatic Pushback and Systemic Costs**

A shared network is not a passive library but an active system under constant pressure from **pragmatic pushback**: our model's term for the systemic analogue of what Quine called a "recalcitrant experience." It is the sum of the concrete, non-negotiable consequences that arise when a network's principles are applied. This feedback is not an argument but a material outcome: a bridge collapses, a treatment fails, a society fragments. This process generates two types of costs.

**First-Order Costs** are the direct, material consequences: failed predictions, wasted resources, or systemic instability. **Systemic Costs** are the secondary, internal costs a network incurs to manage, suppress, or explain away its first-order costs. Key forms include:

*   **Conceptual Debt:** The compounding fragility incurred by adopting flawed, complex "patches" to protect a core principle.
*   **Coercive Overheads:** The measurable resources allocated to enforcing compliance and managing dissent. Dissent, in this model, is a critical data stream signaling that a system is generating costs for its members.

### **2.4 A Diagnostic Framework for Assessing Brittleness**

To make the concept of systemic health analytically useful, we must be able to identify its empirical correlates. A system's **brittleness** is a measure of its accumulated systemic costs. While this cannot be quantified into a single, simple metric, its presence can be diagnosed by observing a cluster of indicators. The following are not proposed as a formal "toolkit" for a social science, but as conceptual guides for the kind of historical and structural analysis this philosophical framework requires. Key indicators include the rate of ad-hoc modification, the ratio of coercion to production, and increasing model complexity for marginal gains.

The operationalization of brittleness faces a circularity problem: measuring costs objectively appears to require the very epistemic framework our theory aims to provide. This circularity cannot be eliminated but can be managed by anchoring measurements in basic biological or physical constraints (demographic collapse, infrastructure failure), using comparative rather than absolute measures, and requiring convergent evidence across multiple indicators.

A skeptical reader might still object that identifying even "demographic collapse" as a cost presupposes a normative commitment to survival. This objection, however, misconstrues the nature of the argument. The framework does not need to posit survival as an external moral good. Rather, it treats the persistence of a system's practitioners as a *constitutive precondition for the practice of inquiry itself*. A knowledge system that reliably leads to the extinction of its own community of inquirers is not merely failing by some external standard; it is failing in a way that is pragmatically self-refuting. The "costs" are thus anchored not in a contested theory of the good, but in the necessary conditions for any cumulative, inter-generational epistemic project to exist at all.

## **3. The Drivers of Adaptation: The Logic of Systemic Viability**

The framework for assessing systemic health is not an arbitrary set of metrics. Its indicators are effective because they are the observable outputs of the selective pressures that drive the evolution of knowledge systems.

### **3.1 Grounding Epistemic Norms in Systemic Viability**

A standard objection to naturalistic epistemology is that a descriptive account of how we *do* reason cannot ground a prescriptive account of how we *ought* to reason (Kim 1988). Our framework answers this "normativity objection" by grounding its norms not in chosen values, but in the structural conditions required for any cumulative inquiry to succeed over time.

Following Quine, we treat normative epistemology as a form of engineering, where norms are hypothetical imperatives directed at a practical goal. Our framework makes this goal concrete: the cultivation of low-brittleness knowledge systems. The authority for this approach rests on a constitutive argument: any system engaged in a cumulative, inter-generational project must maintain sufficient stability to preserve and transmit knowledge. The pressure to maintain a low-brittleness design is therefore not an optional value but an inescapable structural constraint on the practice of cumulative inquiry itself.

This grounding goes deeper. The constraint structure imposes a procedural necessity: for any normative system to become an object of sustained discourse, it must persist long enough to generate that discourse. Persistence is not guaranteed. Those systems that do persist do so by navigating pragmatic constraints with sufficient efficiency to avoid collapse. This is not a chosen value but an evolutionary filter. The "objectivity" of the resulting norms is structural—an objective fact about which architectures can sustain the practice of inquiry itself. The "ought" emerges from recognizing that if you engage in shared deliberation, you must operate within constraints that make such deliberation sustainable.

### **3.2 Coherence as Forward-Looking Risk Assessment**

Framed by the logic of viability, the test for coherence is a thick, forward-looking cost-benefit analysis. A resource-constrained system uses heuristics to bet on whether adopting a new proposition will increase or decrease its long-term brittleness. The traditional epistemic virtues are the core principles of this practical calculus: logical consistency, explanatory power, simplicity, and evidential support. This forward-looking model also explains how revolutionary science is possible. When a dominant network exhibits high and rising systemic brittleness—a Kuhnian "crisis"—the cost-benefit analysis shifts dramatically. A radical new hypothesis may promise a massive long-term reduction in systemic costs. Coherence, in this dynamic sense, is not a conservative check for conformity, but a pragmatic assessment of a proposition's potential to resolve systemic crisis.

## **4. Convergence and the Emergence of Objective Structures**

The logic of viability detailed in Section 3 provides the selective pressure that drives the evolution of knowledge systems. This section builds the theory of objectivity that this dynamic process makes possible, showing how the descriptive project of identifying high-brittleness systems provides a rigorous, empirical methodology for charting the landscape of what is pragmatically viable.

### **4.1 A Negative Methodology: Charting What Fails**

Our account of objectivity begins not with a speculative vision of a final truth, but with the most unambiguous form of empirical evidence available: large-scale systemic failure. Following a broadly Popperian insight, our most secure knowledge is often of what is demonstrably unworkable. The systematic analysis of these failures allows us to build the **Negative Canon**: a robust, evidence-based catalogue of principles and network designs that have been empirically invalidated by the significant systemic costs they reliably generate. By charting what demonstrably fails, we are not merely learning what to avoid; we are effectively reverse-engineering the constraints of a real territory. The Negative Canon functions like a reef chart for inquiry, marking the impassable terrain on the landscape of viability. This provides a hard, external boundary that disciplines all forms of inquiry and prevents a collapse into relativism.

### **4.2 The Apex Network: Emergent Necessity and Structural Realism**

We argue that as unviable designs are relegated to the Negative Canon, this pragmatic selection constructively reveals the contours of an objective structure that all successful inquiry is forced to approximate. We will refer to this emergent structure as the **Apex Network**. To be precise, this term does not refer to a pre-existing entity or metaphysical blueprint awaiting discovery. Rather, it is the name for the set of principles and relational structures that would necessarily characterize any maximally viable knowledge system, given the mind-independent pragmatic constraints of the world. It is a structural invariant that emerges from the landscape of possible solutions.

The argument for its necessity proceeds as follows:
1.  Reality imposes non-negotiable constraints (physical, biological, logical, social).
2.  These constraints generate a fitness landscape of possible configurations with viable and unviable paths.
3.  Given a constrained system, optimal solutions emerge necessarily from the constraint topology, existing whether anyone has calculated them.
4.  The Apex Network *is* that emergent optimal structure.

Historical filtering is therefore the **discovery process**, not the creation mechanism. This gives the Apex Network counterfactual stability: if history had unfolded differently, we would have discovered the same structure through alternative paths, because it is determined by constraints, not by historical contingency.

Ontologically, the Apex Network is best understood as an **emergent structural invariant**: a stable topology within the space of possible knowledge systems. Its reality is akin to that of a fitness peak in an evolutionary landscape—an objective feature of the terrain. To clarify this naturalized status, consider how objective structural facts can emerge from seemingly subjective domains, such as color perception. While an individual's color preference seems contingent, a non-random, cross-cultural pattern emerges from aggregated data: a striking convergence on the color blue. This pattern is not an accident but an emergent structural fact. The "pragmatic pushback" shaping this landscape is the deep history of evolutionary selection on our shared biology, where efficiently tracking ecologically critical signals conferred a viability advantage (Berlin and Kay 1969). A proposition like `'{associating blue with positive, stable conditions} is a viable perceptual default'` is not a metaphysical rule but a point of maximal, stable convergence. The Apex Network, we argue, has the same ontological status: it is not a pre-existing entity to be found, but the objective, structural residue left after a long history of pragmatic filtering has eliminated less viable alternatives.

### **4.3 A Three-Level Framework for Truth**

This emergent structure grounds a fallibilist but realist account of truth, resolving the isolation objection and clarifying a tension in Quine's thought between truth as immanent and transcendent. It reframes truth as a status propositions earn through increasingly rigorous stages of validation.

*   **Level 3: Contextual Coherence.** A proposition is coherent *within a specific Shared Network*, regardless of that network’s long-term viability.
*   **Level 2: Justified Truth.** The highest epistemic status practically achievable. A proposition is justified as true if it is certified by a **Consensus Network** that has a demonstrated track record of low systemic brittleness.
*   **Level 1: Objective Truth.** The ultimate, regulative ideal. A proposition is objectively true if its principles are part of the real, emergent **Apex Network**. While this structure is never fully mapped, it functions as the formal standard that makes our comparative judgments of "more" or "less" brittle meaningful.

This layered framework avoids a simplistic "Whig history." Newtonian mechanics earned its Level 2 status by being a maximally low-brittleness system for its problem-space for over two centuries. Its replacement by relativity does not retroactively invalidate that status but shows the evolutionary process at work.

## **5. The Dynamism of the Web: How Knowledge Becomes Entrenched**

Quine’s "Web of Belief" provided a powerful static model of a knowledge system, but it lacked a corresponding dynamic account of its formation and change. This section provides that dynamic physiology, detailing the naturalistic process by which a successful discovery migrates from the tentative "periphery" of the web to its load-bearing "core."

### **5.1 From Tentative Hypothesis to Core Principle**

A proposition is promoted to the core by demonstrating its immense value in lowering the entire network’s systemic brittleness. The principle of the Conservation of Energy, for example, began as a contested hypothesis. It migrated inward as it proved its indispensable explanatory power across mechanics, chemistry, and electromagnetism, making its revision increasingly costly. Finally, it became a default assumption embedded in the very infrastructure of science. Its position in the core is a direct measure of the significant rise in systemic brittleness that its removal would cause. This process is driven by a powerful, naturalistic pressure. As Herbert Simon (1972) argued, real-world agents operate under bounded rationality. The migration of proven principles to the core is a form of systemic caching. By entrenching its most successful discoveries, a resource-constrained system avoids the crippling cost of re-deriving everything from first principles for every new problem.

### **5.2 The Payoff: An Animated Web**

This process provides the two missing mechanisms needed to animate Quine’s static web. First, it supplies a robust externalist filter—pragmatic pushback—that grounds the web in a world of non-discursive consequences, solving the isolation objection. Second, it provides a directed learning mechanism—the entrenchment of pragmatically indispensable principles—that explains how the core of the web is systematically constructed over time.

## **6. Situating the Framework: Systemic Externalism and Its Relations**

This paper has developed what can be termed **Systemic Externalism**—a form of externalist epistemology that locates justification not in individual cognitive processes but in the demonstrated reliability of entire knowledge systems. This section clarifies the framework's position by examining its relationship to several major philosophical research programs.

### **6.1 An Evolutionary Grounding for Social Epistemology**

Our framework provides a naturalistic foundation for the core insights of social epistemology (e.g., Longino 2002). Social epistemic procedures like peer review and institutionalized criticism persist because they demonstrably reduce systemic brittleness by helping networks detect errors and pay down conceptual debt. This provides the crucial externalist check that purely procedural models can lack. It also offers an empirical grounding for the central insight of standpoint theory (Harding 1991): marginalized perspectives can be a privileged source of data about systemic flaws.

### **6.2 Refining Philosophy of Science: Lakatos and Laudan**

This approach also allows us to refine the valuable insights of twentieth-century philosophy of science. While Imre Lakatos (1970) provides a brilliant historical description of "degenerating research programmes," our framework offers the underlying causal mechanism. Brittleness is a measure of the accumulated systemic costs that *cause* a program to become degenerative, offering quantifiable indicators where Lakatos gave a more qualitative classification. Similarly, where Larry Laudan (1977) retrospectively tallies a theory's "problem-solving effectiveness," our concept of brittleness functions as a forward-looking diagnostic of systemic risk. A system could have a high problem-solving score in Laudan's sense while simultaneously accumulating hidden costs that make it profoundly vulnerable to future shocks.

### **6.3 A Realist Corrective for Neopragmatism**

Our model retains the anti-foundationalist spirit of pragmatism while providing a decisive realist corrective to neopragmatist accounts (e.g., Rorty 1979) that risk reducing objectivity to social consensus. Our framework provides the missing non-discursive external check through the analysis of systemic failure. The collapse of Lysenkoist biology was not due to a breakdown in its internal discourse but to unsustainable first-order costs. Lasting solidarity is not an alternative to objectivity; it is an emergent property of a low-brittleness network that has successfully adapted to pragmatic constraints.

### **6.4 A Naturalistic Engine for Structural Realism**

Our concept of the Apex Network shares deep affinities with scientific structural realism (Worrall 1989) while providing what that position often lacks: a fully naturalized, causal mechanism for convergence. The Apex Network *is* the complete set of viable relational structures, but it is an emergent structural fact about our world, discovered retrospectively through the historical process of culling what fails. High-brittleness networks collapse and enter the Negative Canon. Low-brittleness networks survive. This failure-driven selective pressure is the engine that forces our Consensus Networks to conform to the objective, relational structure of the Apex Network.

### **6.5 Mathematics as a Paradigm Case of Internal Brittleness**

Naturalistic epistemologies often treat mathematics as a difficult boundary case. Our framework, however, treats it as a paradigm demonstration of its core mechanisms. Mathematical knowledge evolves under pragmatic pressure, but the feedback is entirely internal. Mathematical brittleness manifests not as failed physical predictions, but as rising *internal inefficiency*. For example, the discovery of Russell's paradox in naive set theory revealed a state of infinite brittleness, paralyzing all inference. The subsequent development of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory and Type Theory were competing attempts to create a new, low-brittleness foundation. Similarly, a mathematical research program that requires proofs of escalating complexity for diminishing explanatory returns is exhibiting the classic signs of a degenerating, high-brittleness system.

## **7. Defending the Model: Addressing Key Challenges**

A philosophical model must be tested against its most difficult cases. This section demonstrates the resilience of our framework by engaging directly with core challenges in epistemology.

### **7.1 The Problem of History: Endurance, Hindsight, and Real-Time Diagnosis**

A powerful challenge concerns the interpretation of history: if viability is the standard, how do we account for flawed systems that endure for centuries? Our framework sharply distinguishes mere *endurance* from pragmatic *viability*. The model predicts that brittle systems can persist, but only by paying immense and measurable systemic costs. This distinction is critical for addressing concerns about power and oppression. Consider slavery: from the perspective of slave-owners, the system may have appeared low-cost. But from a systems perspective, slavery was objectively brittle regardless of how slave-owners experienced it. The evidence: immense coercive overheads, chronic instability, and massive opportunity costs. The exercise of power to maintain an unjust system does not negate its brittleness; rather, the coercive costs required become a primary diagnostic indicator. The goal of this framework is not deterministic prediction but epistemic risk management. Retrospective analysis of historical cases calibrates our diagnostic tools. We study known failures to learn the empirical signatures of rising brittleness before applying these tools to live, unresolved debates.

### **7.2 The Problem of Scope: From Systemic Health to Individual Belief**

It is crucial to be precise about this model's scope. It is a macro-epistemology, designed to explain the long-term viability of public knowledge systems. It does not primarily aim to solve traditional problems in micro-epistemology (e.g., Gettier cases). Instead, it provides a robust bridge between these levels through the concept of higher-order evidence. The diagnosed health of a public system provides a powerful defeater (or corroborator) for an individual’s beliefs derived from that system. The diagnosed brittleness of a knowledge system should determine the rational prior probability an agent assigns to any claim from that source. The macro-level diagnosis thus provides a rational, quantitative basis for allocating trust.

### **7.3 Scope and Principled Limitations**

Philosophical honesty requires acknowledging what a framework does and does not claim to do.

*   **Species-Specific Objectivity:** Moral and epistemic truths, as discovered through this process, are objective for creatures with our biological and social architecture. Hypothetical beings with radically different structures would face different constraints and discover different optimal configurations. This is relativism at the species level, not the cultural level.
*   **The Problem of Historical Failure:** This framework suggests that much of our most secure objective knowledge is discovered through the analysis of large-scale systemic failures. The Negative Canon is, in effect, a record of historical suffering. This raises a difficult conclusion: our knowledge of what constitutes a viable social system seems to depend on the data generated by unviable ones.
*   **Floor Not Ceiling:** The framework maps necessary constraints (the floor), not sufficient conditions for flourishing (the ceiling). It identifies catastrophic failures, leaving substantial space for legitimate value pluralism above that floor.
*   **Expert Dependence:** Accurate brittleness assessment requires technical expertise. This creates epistemic inequality similar to scientific expertise generally, creating democratic legitimacy challenges that require institutional solutions (e.g., data transparency, standpoint epistemology).

These limitations do not undermine the framework's contribution—they define its appropriate scope.

## **8. Conclusion**

This paper has developed Emergent Pragmatic Coherentism as a response to the isolation objection facing coherentist theories of justification. By grounding coherence in the demonstrated viability of knowledge systems, measured through their capacity to minimize systemic costs, we have outlined a naturalistic account of objectivity that avoids both the solipsism of pure internalism and the implausibility of foundationalism.

Our framework for assessing systemic brittleness makes this process analyzable. By systematically studying the record of failed systems, we can begin to discern the contours of the Apex Network: the emergent set of maximally convergent, pragmatically indispensable principles that successful inquiry is forced to discover. The result is a form of Systemic Externalism that offers a novel approach for resolving long-standing problems in post-Quinean epistemology by grounding justification in the non-discursive filter of systemic consequences.

While this framework operates at a high level of abstraction, its primary data streams originate from the ground up. As we have argued, systemic costs are ultimately experienced by individuals as suffering, instability, and the frustration of human goals. Dissent, friction, and protest are therefore not merely political problems; they are primary sources of epistemological data about a system's rising brittleness. This framework, in this light, is best understood as a tool for a democratic public to hold its own knowledge-generating systems accountable. By making the indicators of systemic health part of a shared, evidence-based language, it helps us ask the most pragmatic question of all: "Is this way of thinking, this way of organizing ourselves, still working for us?"
