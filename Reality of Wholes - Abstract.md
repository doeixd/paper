# Abstract: The Reality of Wholes

Mereological nihilism claims there are no hurricanes, only particles arranged hurricane-wise; no cells, only atoms arranged cell-wise. This paper argues that once we accept four uncontroversial premises—causality, locality, information, and thermodynamics—statistical boundaries become inevitable features of physical reality, not optional human conventions.

These boundaries create causal autonomy: systems become predictable and controllable through their boundaries alone, independent of external microstructure. We formalize this using the ε-machine/υ-machine framework from computational mechanics. When macro-variables predict future states as well as complete micro-data, the system has achieved computational closure. The whole genuinely causes its own future states.

This creates a dilemma for the nihilist. If "facts about arrangements" perform all the causal work objects were supposed to do—supporting intervention, enabling prediction, structuring scientific practice—then denying their reality becomes empty verbalism. The boundary does not label pre-existing molecules; it creates a new causal architecture. That architecture is the object.

We defend this view against retreats to "mere usefulness," address challenges from consciousness, and demonstrate practical implications across medicine, ecology, and technology. The argument does not force concession but makes nihilism obsolete. Wholes are inevitable where prediction, control, and compression converge. To be real is to be a pattern that any sufficiently capable intelligence, constrained by this universe's physics, is forced to discover. The hurricane is as real as its molecules.
