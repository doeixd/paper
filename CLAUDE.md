Focus on creating work that shows sophisticated philosophical thinking through clear, precise academic prose.


After every large edit. write a summary of the changes, and explanation behind it. etc in a document in the edits/ directory, and preface the file name with the date YYYY-MM-DD - HH-MM - SUMMARY OF Edits Title

the paper is in paper.md

Use good judgement when integrating specific suggestions. make sure they align with our preferences, and make sense in the paper.


ALWAYS FIRST CREATE A DETAILED PLAN / TODO LIST

DONT REPEAT YOURSELF. CHECK FOR KEYWORDS / SECTIONS TO MAKE SURE

WE DONT HAVE TO BE SCIENTIFIC, JUST LOGICAL, HOLD THE reader's hand down the logical path, these are our assumptions, then if this, then this

DONT BE SCARED OF NUANCE AND FALIBILITY

BE HUMBLE, CAVEAT, Use plain language where possible


git commit with detailed summary / rational, etc after you've complelted everything. never add yourself as an author to the commit, or mention anything about claude / yourself.

if you have sub-agents. dont be scared of using them

## Available Tools and Scripts

### Enhanced Citation Extraction Script (`citation_extractor.py`)
- **Purpose**: Automatically scans markdown files for both parenthetical and in-prose citations, extracts context, and matches to full references
- **Basic Usage**:
  - `python citation_extractor.py` - Scans all .md files
  - `python citation_extractor.py final.md` - Scans specific file
  - `python citation_extractor.py final.md -o my_output.txt` - Custom output file
- **Command-Line Options**:
  - `-o, --output FILE` - Custom output filename (default: citations_found.txt)
  - `-a, --append` - Append to existing file instead of overwriting
  - `-q, --quiet` - Suppress progress messages
  - `-h, --help` - Show usage help
- **Citation Detection**: Finds TWO types of citations:
  - **Parenthetical**: `(Author 2020)`, `(Author et al. 2020, p. 45)`
  - **In-prose**: `Goldman (1979)`, `Acemoglu and Robinson (2012)`, `Sevilla et al. (2022)`
- **Output**: Writes to specified file with structured formatting including:
  - Citation type (PARENTHETICAL or IN-PROSE)
  - File location and line number
  - Full citation text
  - Contextual text (3 lines before and after)
  - Complete reference entry from `references.md`
  - "NOT FOUND" warning if reference missing
  - Results grouped by file for organization
- **Reference Matching**: Intelligent matching handles:
  - Primary author vs. full author names
  - "et al." citations (strips and matches primary author)
  - "and" vs. "&" variations
  - Multiple citation formats for same source
- **Coverage**: Processes specified files or all `.md` files (excluding `references.md` and files starting with `citations_`)
- **Use Case**: Comprehensive audit of all scholarly citations for verification, consistency checking, and ensuring all citations have corresponding references
- **Documentation**: See `CITATION_EXTRACTOR_README.md` for complete usage guide and examples
