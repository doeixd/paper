After every large edit. write a summary of the changes, and explanation behind it. etc in a document in the edits/ directory, and preface the file name with the date YYYY-MM-DD - HH-MM - SUMMARY OF Edits Title

ALWAYS FIRST CREATE A DETAILED PLAN / TODO LIST

DONT REPEAT YOURSELF. CHECK FOR KEYWORDS / SECTIONS TO MAKE SURE

WE DONT HAVE TO BE SCIENTIFIC, JUST LOGICAL, HOLD THE reader's hand down the logical path, these are our assumptions, then if this, then this

DONT BE SCARED OF NUANCE AND FALIBILITY

git commit with detailed summary / rational, etc after you've complelted everything. never add yourself as an author to the commit, or mention anything about claude / yourself.

if you have sub-agents. dont be scared of using them
