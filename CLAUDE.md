We are writing an ACADEMPIC PHILOSOPHY PAPER.

Not a hard science paper. and not a manifesto or blog post. 

Things to remember:
My writing style is simple, but clear & detailed.
Make writing authoritative without being overconfident, and complex without being unnecessarily dense.
Use clear, measured, academic tone.
Don't use unnecessary jargon.
Pre-empt any misunderstandings or objections.
Don't have a grandiose tone, maintain humility, but confidence.
Try and keep concise writing, without redundant or wordy phrases, while still maintaining maximum detail and clarity.
Includes appropriate qualifications while still making strong claims.
Be philosophically precise.
Anticipate reviewer criticism, and address it.
Whenever suggesting specific edits. Give the location, what to delete (if needed) and then the full copy/pasteable section. For easy revision.

You are helping write a HIGH-QUALITY ACADEMIC PHILOSOPHY PAPER for peer review publication. This is not a hard science paper, manifesto, or blog post.

## Writing Style Guidelines:
- **Personal Style**: Simple, clear, and detailed writing that maintains maximum precision
- **Tone**: Authoritative without being overconfident; complex without being unnecessarily dense
- **Academic Voice**: Clear, measured academic tone with appropriate humility but confidence
- **Language**: Avoid unnecessary jargon while maintaining philosophical precision
- **Concision**: Keep writing concise without redundant or wordy phrases, while preserving maximum detail and clarity
- Dont overuse boldface.
- Dont use em dashes.
- no footnotes, just explain in writing

## Content Standards:
- **Anticipatory**: Pre-empt any misunderstandings or objections before they arise
- **Balanced**: Include appropriate qualifications while still making strong claims
- **Rigorous**: Be philosophically precise in all conceptual distinctions
- **Defensive**: Anticipate reviewer criticism and address it proactively
- **Minimal Terminology**: Don't introduce unneeded named concepts if it can be avoided
- **Scholarly**: Use appropriate citations to support claims


Be careful to always maintain existing qualifications / defenses, important details, and citations, when revising.

## Quality Standards:
- Does this avoid grandiose tone while maintaining confidence?
- Would philosophy reviewers find the arguments compelling and well-defended?
- Is every claim as strong as the evidence allows without overreach?
- Does the writing demonstrate mastery while remaining accessible?

Use appropirate citations, and add them in Chicago format, in alphbetical order to references.md

Focus on creating work that shows sophisticated philosophical thinking through clear, precise academic prose.


After every large edit. write a summary of the changes, and explanation behind it. etc in a document in the edits/ directory, and preface the file name with the date YYYY-MM-DD - HH-MM - SUMMARY OF Edits Title

the paper is in paper.md

Use good judgement when integrating specific suggestions. make sure they align with our preferences, and make sense in the paper.


ALWAYS FIRST CREATE A DETAILED PLAN / TODO LIST

DONT REPEAT YOURSELF. CHECK FOR KEYWORDS / SECTIONS TO MAKE SURE

WE DONT HAVE TO BE SCIENTIFIC, JUST LOGICAL, HOLD THE reader's hand down the logical path, these are our assumptions, then if this, then this

DONT BE SCARED OF NUANCE AND FALIBILITY

BE HUMBLE, CAVEAT, Use plain language where possible


git commit with detailed summary / rational, etc after you've complelted everything. never add yourself as an author to the commit, or mention anything about claude / yourself.

if you have sub-agents. dont be scared of using them

## Available Tools and Scripts

### Enhanced Citation Extraction Script (`citation_extractor.py`)
- **Purpose**: Automatically scans markdown files for both parenthetical and in-prose citations, extracts context, matches to full references, and can generate filtered reference lists
- **Basic Usage**:
  - `python citation_extractor.py` - Scans all .md files
  - `python citation_extractor.py final.md` - Scans specific file
  - `python citation_extractor.py final.md -o my_output.txt` - Custom output file
  - `python citation_extractor.py final.md -r final_references.md` - Generate filtered references file
- **Command-Line Options**:
  - `-o, --output FILE` - Custom output filename (default: citations_found.txt)
  - `-r, --generate-references FILE` - **ðŸ†• Generate a references.md file with ONLY cited references**
  - `-a, --append` - Append to existing file instead of overwriting
  - `-q, --quiet` - Suppress progress messages
  - `-h, --help` - Show usage help
- **Citation Detection**: Finds TWO types of citations:
  - **Parenthetical**: `(Author 2020)`, `(Author et al. 2020, p. 45)`
  - **In-prose**: `Goldman (1979)`, `Acemoglu and Robinson (2012)`, `Sevilla et al. (2022)`
- **Output**: Writes to specified file with structured formatting including:
  - Citation type (PARENTHETICAL or IN-PROSE)
  - File location and line number
  - Full citation text
  - Contextual text (3 lines before and after)
  - Complete reference entry from `references.md`
  - "NOT FOUND" warning if reference missing
  - Results grouped by file for organization
- **ðŸ†• Reference File Generation**: The `-r` flag creates a filtered references file containing ONLY citations used in the specified paper:
  - Extracts all citations from your paper
  - Looks up each in master `references.md`
  - Generates new file with only used references
  - Sorts alphabetically
  - Adds metadata (source, date, count)
  - Lists missing citations as comments
  - **Use cases**: Submission-ready reference lists, splitting papers, verifying completeness, cleaning up after edits
- **Reference Matching**: Intelligent matching handles:
  - Primary author vs. full author names
  - "et al." citations (strips and matches primary author)
  - "and" vs. "&" variations
  - Multiple citation formats for same source
- **Coverage**: Processes specified files or all `.md` files (excluding `references.md` and files starting with `citations_`)
- **Use Case**: Comprehensive audit of all scholarly citations for verification, consistency checking, ensuring all citations have corresponding references, and generating submission-ready reference lists
- **Documentation**: See `CITATION_EXTRACTOR_README.md` for complete usage guide and examples

### Paper Converter Script (`paper_converter.py`)
- **Purpose**: Converts markdown academic papers to LaTeX or Typst format with automatically filtered references
- **Basic Usage**:
  - `python paper_converter.py paper.md` - Convert to LaTeX (default)
  - `python paper_converter.py paper.md --format typst` - Convert to Typst
  - `python paper_converter.py paper.md --preamble preamble.tex` - Use custom LaTeX preamble
  - `python paper_converter.py paper.md --output final.tex` - Custom output filename
  - `python paper_converter.py paper.md --keep-temp` - Preserve temporary files for debugging
- **Command-Line Options**:
  - `--format {latex,typst}` - Output format (default: latex)
  - `--preamble FILE` - Custom preamble file for LaTeX (ignored for Typst)
  - `--output FILE` - Custom output filename (auto-generated if not specified)
  - `--keep-temp` - Keep temporary files (filtered refs, combined markdown)
  - `-h, --help` - Show usage help
- **Automated Workflow**:
  1. **Citation Extraction**: Finds all citations in markdown (parenthetical and in-prose)
  2. **Reference Filtering**: Creates filtered reference list with only cited works
  3. **Document Assembly**: Removes existing references section, appends filtered references
  4. **Format Conversion**: Uses pandoc to convert to LaTeX or Typst
- **Citation Detection**: Handles complex citation patterns:
  - **Parenthetical**: `(Author 2020)`, `(Author et al. 2020, p. 45)`
  - **In-prose**: `Goldman (1979)`, `Acemoglu and Robinson (2012)`
- **Reference Processing**: Generates clean, submission-ready reference lists:
  - Filters master `references.md` to include only cited works
  - Sorts alphabetically by primary author
  - Adds metadata (generation date, source file, reference count)
  - Flags missing citations as comments
- **Output Formats**:
  - **LaTeX (.tex)**: Standard LaTeX with optional custom preamble support
  - **Typst (.typ)**: Modern Typst markup for advanced typesetting
- **Use Cases**: Journal submission preparation, format conversion, reference list cleanup, ensuring citation completeness
- **Dependencies**: Requires pandoc for document conversion
