In this book, Cartwright challenges the idea of a world completely ordered by a single, elegant theory, arguing instead for a "patchwork" of laws and regularities. She emphasizes the importance of "causal capacities" or "powers" of things, which are stable properties that give rise to specific behaviors under certain conditions.
