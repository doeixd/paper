Citation 1 [PARENTHETICAL]:
Line: 103
Citation: (Fogel and Engerman 1974)

Context:
#### Measuring C(t): The Coercion Ratio

C(t) = (resources for internal coercion) / (total economic output). For example, Virginia in 1850 allocated ~2.5% of economic output to coercion (vs. 0.8-1.2% in Northern states), rising from 1.8% (1820) to 3.1% (1860), indicating escalating maintenance costs (Fogel and Engerman 1974).

Citation 2 [PARENTHETICAL]:
Line: 137
Citation: (World Bank 2012)

Context:
EPC analyzes ongoing debates like patriarchy's decline. The predicate "women's roles are private and subordinate" proves profoundly inefficient: massive economic losses from excluding half the population; informational costs from silencing female perspectives; high coercive costs enforcing rigid roles.

Transition to egalitarianism involves short-term friction costs from social conflict. However, this is an investment that pays down patriarchal debt. Feminist critique wagers that fully utilizing all human resources yields greater long-term innovation and resilience (lower SBI). This transforms value clashes into empirical questions about social design efficiency. This wager is increasingly supported by development economics, which finds strong correlations between gender equality in education and economic participation and metrics of national prosperity and stability (World Bank 2012, Duflo 2012).

Citation 4 [PARENTHETICAL]:
Line: 215
Citation: (Boyd 1988)

Context:
Pragmatic Procedural Realism is the metaethical instantiation of Emergent Pragmatic Coherentism. While EPC provides the general theory of justification applicable across all domains, Pragmatic Procedural Realism specifies how that framework operates in the normative domain. The relationship is one of general theory to domain-specific application: EPC is the diagnostic methodology, Pragmatic Procedural Realism is its normative realization.

Pragmatic Procedural Realism is a naturalistic moral realism (Boyd 1988, Railton 1986). Its objectivity claims are:

- **Realist**: Objective, mind-independent truths exist about normative viability. "Slavery is wrong" refers to structural facts about predicates' incoherence with the Apex Network, the emergent structure of viable norms.
- **Procedural**: Moral truths are emergent relational facts discovered historically. Truth-makers are objective facts about networks' pragmatic resilience (low SBI).

Citation 6 [PARENTHETICAL]:
Line: 243
Citation: (March 1978)

Context:
Biological Constraints. These are empirical facts discoverable through physiology and epidemiology without normative commitments. Humans require minimum caloric intake (approximately 1,500-2,000 calories per day). Chronic malnutrition produces immune dysfunction, elevated mortality, and demographic decline. Extended childhood dependency requires caregiver investment. Social isolation causes measurable harm. Systems violating these requirements incur objective, measurable costs—mortality, morbidity, demographic collapse—independent of anyone's values.

Cognitive Constraints. Psychology, cognitive science, and behavioral economics reveal bounded rationality (March 1978): humans cannot compute optimal solutions in real-time. Working memory is limited to roughly seven items. Coordination failures occur without institutional support. Social learning has specific capacities and limitations constraining information transmission. These constraints determine which normative architectures are implementable. Systems requiring perfect rationality or unlimited processing cannot function with human agents. These are empirical facts about cognition, not value judgments.

Coordination Constraints. Game theory and institutional economics show cooperation requires enforcement mechanisms under potential defection (Axelrod 1984). Common-pool resources require boundary rules and monitoring (Ostrom 1990). Large-scale coordination requires division of labor and information aggregation. These are mathematical facts about strategic interaction under specified conditions, derivable from formal models, not normative intuitions.

Physical Constraints. Physics, ecology, and thermodynamics establish that energy must be extracted to sustain organization. Entropy requires continuous work to maintain structure. Finite resources constrain population and consumption. These impose hard limits on social organization.

Citation: (March 1978)

Context:
2. Migration Inward: As it demonstrates immense value in lowering systemic brittleness (reducing C(t) by increasing legitimacy and stability), its revision becomes prohibitively costly. It becomes a Standing Predicate used to vet new laws and policies.
3. Core Principle (Systemic Caching): Its indispensability becomes so profound that it is embedded in the infrastructure of viable legal systems (constitutions, legal training, judicial review). This systemic caching is a rational response to bounded rationality; the system entrenches its most successful discoveries to avoid re-deriving them for every new case.

A core moral principle is not a self-evident axiom but a piece of highly optimized social technology that has survived rigorous pragmatic stress-testing. Its justification is its proven, indispensable functional role in viable social architectures. This entrenchment reflects pragmatic indispensability driven by bounded rationality (March 1978). The costs of revision become effectively infinite. Revising basic justice principles requires abandoning the conceptual tools needed to coordinate social expectations, resolve disputes, or maintain legitimate authority. After centuries of implementation, legal systems worldwide presuppose core fairness principles. Revision would generate catastrophic first-order costs, undermining the stability and legitimacy on which functional governance depends.

Citation 10 [PARENTHETICAL]:
Line: 355
Citation: (Putnam 2002)

Context:
**Objection: Moral Progress Skepticism** - Progress claims are Western bias. **Reply:** Framework predicts pluralist periphery but universal floor. Progress diagnosed empirically via SBI reduction, not cultural superiority.

**Objection: Scientific Imperialism** - Reducing ethics to science (Putnam 2002). **Reply:** Not scientism but unified pragmatic filter. Moral claims remain normative but justified externally like scientific ones.

**Objection: Evolutionary Debunking** - Evolutionary pressures shaped moral intuitions for survival, not truth (Street 2006; Sterelny 2012). **Reply:** EPC resolves Street's dilemma by collapsing one of its horns. The dilemma assumes that truth and adaptiveness are independent aims, making their alignment a coincidence. Our framework denies this premise. For us, moral truth *is* a specific, demanding form of long-term systemic adaptiveness (i.e., viability). Evolution is not a distorting influence that the realist must explain away; it is the broader category of filtering processes within which the specific, cost-based discovery of moral truth takes place. Pragmatic viability is what moral truth supervenes on.

**Objection: The Naturalistic Fallacy.** The framework seems to define 'the good' as 'the viable,' improperly deriving a value from a fact. **Reply:** This misinterprets the project. We offer a naturalistic reconstruction of the function of our normative practice. The claim is that what our successful moral discourse has actually been tracking are facts about systemic viability. 'Wrongness' is not being defined as high-brittleness; rather, high-brittleness is the underlying natural property that the term 'wrongness' has been imperfectly latching onto. This is a semantic externalist move: just as 'water' successfully referred to H₂O long before we understood molecular chemistry, 'wrong' has been successfully tracking high-brittleness principles long before we developed the diagnostic tools to measure it explicitly. This naturalizes the reference of our moral terms, explaining their functional authority without committing a fallacy.

Citation 13 [PARENTHETICAL]:
Line: 365
Citation: (Rawls 1971)

Context:
**Objection: Hindsight Rationalization.** The framework can only diagnose brittleness after failure, making it merely retrospective rather than providing prospective guidance. **Reply:** This misunderstands the calibration process. We use clear historical data (the Negative Canon) to calibrate our diagnostic instruments, identifying the empirical signatures that reliably precede collapse. These calibrated instruments then enable prospective diagnosis, not deterministic prediction, but epistemic risk assessment for contemporary systems. This parallels medical science: we learn disease patterns from past cases to diagnose present patients before symptoms become catastrophic. The framework thus operates in two stages: retrospective calibration using historical failures to identify brittleness indicators, then prospective application of these calibrated metrics to assess current systems and identify degenerating research programs before collapse.

**Objection: Why Historical over Idealized Procedures?** Contemporary constructivists (Rawls 1971, Korsgaard 1996) also ground normativity in procedures, but use idealized rational procedures (original position, categorical imperative procedure) rather than historical filtering. What makes PPR's historical procedure superior? Doesn't idealization avoid the contamination of actual history by power, ignorance, and bias?

**Reply:** There are three problems with idealized procedures and corresponding advantages to historical ones.

Citation: (Acemoglu and Robinson 2012)

Context:
We accept this implication for intellectual honesty. The framework maps pragmatic viability, not all moral dimensions. If such a system existed, it would fall in the Pluralist Frontier, not the Negative Canon.

However, our empirical wager is that such systems are inherently brittle. Apparent stability in historical examples like Ottoman devşirme or Indian caste systems masked high coercive overheads, innovation lags, and fragility under shocks (Acemoglu and Robinson 2012, Turchin 2003). True, cost-free internalization is likely a sociological impossibility. Oppression generates hidden costs that manifest under stress. Even systems like *Brave New World* that suppress cognitive capacities incur massive information suppression costs (Tier 2) that cripple long-term adaptation.
