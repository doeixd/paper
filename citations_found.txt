Citation 1 [PARENTHETICAL]:
Line: 13
Citation: (Dennett 1991)

Context:
This constrains the nihilist's position to a largely terminological dispute. If "facts about arrangements" perform all the causal work objects were supposed to do (supporting intervention, enabling prediction, structuring scientific practice), then denying their reality becomes empty verbalism. The boundary does not label pre-existing molecules; it creates a new causal architecture. That architecture is the object.

We defend this view against retreats to "mere usefulness," address challenges from consciousness, and demonstrate practical implications across medicine, ecology, and technology. Where causal powers, counterfactual stability, and resistance to informational intrusion converge, objecthood is established. Wholes are not fundamental, but they are metaphysically real as "Real Patterns" (Dennett 1991) and unified loci of causal powers. Any sufficiently capable agent will converge on these patterns, since ignoring them incurs unsustainable complexity. The hurricane is as real as its molecules in this sense.

Citation 2 [PARENTHETICAL]:
Line: 56
Citation: (Woodward 2003)

Context:
Before proceeding, we must clarify what we mean by "causal work." This matters because the nihilist might grant that boundaries are useful while denying they are real.

Here we adopt the interventionist theory of causation (Woodward 2003; Pearl 2000): $X$ causes $Y$ if intervening on $X$ changes $Y$, holding other factors fixed. On this view, causation is not about "little things banging into other things" but about which variables make a difference under intervention. When macro-variables support successful intervention (steering a hurricane by seeding clouds, curing a disease by targeting a pathway, crashing a market by changing interest rates), those variables are doing causal work. On the interventionist account of causation, successful macro-level interventions establish that macro-variables are causally sufficient for prediction and control. This establishes explanatory and interventional autonomy, not ontological fundamentality.

Predictive equivalence matters because it reveals which level of description captures the intervention-relevant structure. If macro-variables predict as well as micro-variables, then the macro-level *is* the causal level for that phenomenon. Adding micro-detail changes nothing about what interventions will succeed.

Citation 4 [PARENTHETICAL]:
Line: 72
Citation: (Dennett 1991)

Context:
This position appears scientific but conflates material substrate with causal structure. To be fair, this reductionist view has been spectacularly successful for its intended domain: understanding fundamental forces by smashing atoms. But most of science, and indeed all of life, is not about smashing atoms. The four premises do not merely *allow* boundaries; they robustly select for them in certain configurations. A cup's boundary is not an abstract essence of "cup-ness"; it is the measurable fact that its walls screen off the liquid's temperature from external atoms.

Here is the *tu quoque*: The nihilist assumes particles are self-subsistent objects in the soup. But quantum mechanics (entanglement, indistinguishability) shows particles lack inherent self-identity. You cannot tag an electron and track it like a billiard ball. They are nodes in a relational structure. This means they have no ontological privilege over "wholes." Both are "Real Patterns" (Dennett 1991) in the formalism. If nothing is an inherently "separate" object at the base level, the nihilist's attempt to deny higher-order objects based on their composition loses its anchor. The "soup" is not made of things; it is made of constraints.

### Part 1: The Robust Emergence of Statistical Boundaries
Given causality, locality, and information, we can analyze the consequences of local particle interactions. These interactions form causal networks where, under a wide class of configurations, certain nodes screen off others from the rest of the graph.

Citation 5 [IN-PROSE]:
Line: 181
Citation: Rosas et al. (2024)

Context:
Consider a thought experiment: A trumpet is connected to a lightbulb. We derive a mathematical formula that predicts exactly how bright the light will be based on the note played. We possess a description, but do we possess an *explanation*? A skeptic might say no; we have not described the wires or the electrons. We have a rule, not a mechanism.

But the Rosas et al. (2024) framework offers a rebuttal. If a system is causally closed, the 'Trumpet Formula' is not merely a description; it constitutes the *maximal explanation* possible. Two types of prediction machines capture this distinction:

- $\upsilon$-machine (Upsilon): The complete micro-story (tracking every molecule's exact position and velocity).
- $\varepsilon$-machine (Epsilon): The compressed macro-story (using only macro-data like temperature, membrane state, or the note played). The formal theory of the $\varepsilon$-machine (Shalizi & Crutchfield 2001) tells us precisely when these macro-variables are sufficient for prediction.

Citation 6 [PARENTHETICAL]:
Line: 208
Citation: (Landauer 1961)

Context:
This intuition can be formalized via Kolmogorov complexity: Compression functions as a methodological constraint on successful scientific representation. A system that admits a stable, low-complexity description of its causal evolution proves indispensable to explanatory practice and thereby warrants recognition as a real causal power. Where such compression systematically fails, entities lose explanatory standing and, over time, we withdraw our recognition of their existence. The "Shoe-Moon" fails this test because it is algorithmically incompressible relative to its components. The hurricane succeeds because the vortex pattern achieves massive compression.

This compression is not mere notational convenience. Information is physical (Landauer 1961); processing information costs energy (Landauer 1981). Consider the thermodynamic cost. A system that predicts its environment by tracking a single boundary state (the hurricane's pressure) uses vastly less energy than one tracking $10^{23}$ particle trajectories. Natural selection operates on this energetic reality. An organism that models its environment using the "Shoe-Moon" additive method will starve from computational overhead. Evolution selects for compressive boundaries because they minimize the metabolic cost of prediction.

Trivial dimensions are brittle; they require constant ad-hoc parameters to maintain prediction. Genuine dimensions are low-maintenance because they compress the state space. Entities that succeed in reducing the computational cost of prediction earn their status through this methodological success. Boundaries that systematically fail to achieve compression lose explanatory standing and warrant withdrawal of their status as objects.

Citation 8 [PARENTHETICAL]:
Line: 272
Citation: (Block 1978)

Context:
The physical layer provides the capacity for existence, but the structural layer dictates the outcome. The nihilist who insists on reducing everything to the substrate is like a hardware engineer trying to find a spelling error by inspecting the motherboard with a microscope. They are examining the reality of the implementation while missing the reality of the dynamic.

This even resolves the "China Brain" puzzle (Block 1978). If a population of a billion people used walkie-talkies to simulate the firing of neurons, would a collective mind exist? Our framework suggests that if the macro-pattern achieves computational closure, enabling predictions and interventions that tracking the individual citizens cannot, then that "mind" is a valid causal entity. It is software running on a substrate of people, just as Excel runs on a substrate of transistors.

This distinction clarifies how orthogonal dimensions interact without collapsing into incoherent pluralism. How can a legal concept (a warrant) cause a physical event (an arrest)? They interact through the implementation layer. Dimensions are distinct in their causal logic—one cannot explain a tax statute using voltage—but remain tethered by existential dependency. Interaction occurs when a causal chain in one dimension triggers a state change in the implementation layer. This change then propagates upward into another dimension. For example: a judge signs a warrant (Legal Dimension). This moves physical ink on paper (Implementation Layer). This physical token is observed by a police officer, changing their cognitive state (Psychological Dimension), leading to a physical arrest (Physical Dimension). We avoid the "ghost in the machine" problem because we are not positing distinct substances passing through one another; we are describing software processes running on the same hardware.
