Citation 1 [PARENTHETICAL]:
Line: 24
Citation: (Woodward 2003)

Context:
Before proceeding, we must clarify what we mean by "causal work." This matters because the nihilist might grant that boundaries are useful while denying they are real.

Here we adopt the interventionist theory of causation (Woodward 2003; Pearl 2009): $X$ causes $Y$ if intervening on $X$ changes $Y$, holding other factors fixed. On this view, causation is not about "little things banging into other things" but about which variables make a difference under intervention. When macro-variables support successful intervention (steering a hurricane by seeding clouds, curing a disease by targeting a pathway, crashing a market by changing interest rates), those variables are doing causal work in the only sense that matters scientifically. Predictive equivalence matters because it reveals which level of description captures the intervention-relevant structure. If macro-variables predict as well as micro-variables, then the macro-level *is* the causal level for that phenomenon; adding micro-detail changes nothing about what interventions will succeed.

The Ptolemaic objection (that epicycles predicted planetary motion without being real) actually supports our case. Epicycles failed precisely because they did not support intervention: you could not steer a planet by manipulating its epicycle. The macro-objects we defend (cells, hurricanes, economies) pass the interventionist test that epicycles fail.
