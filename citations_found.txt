## 1. Introduction: From a Static Web to a Dynamic Process

Why did germ theory replace miasma theory? A standard explanation cites superior evidence, but a deeper view reveals systemic viability. Miasma theory incurred catastrophic costs—thousands died in London from misdirected public health efforts targeting odors instead of contaminated water—and demanded accelerating ad hoc modifications to address anomalies. Its brittleness is evident in high patch velocity (P(t)); historical analyses (Snow 1855) indicate dozens of modifications by the mid-19th century. Germ theory, conversely, reduced these costs while unifying diverse phenomena.

This shift exemplifies the isolation objection to coherentism: a belief system might be coherent yet detached from reality (BonJour 1985). Coherentists have offered responses (Olsson 2005; Kvanvig 2012), but most rely on internalist resources that lack external constraints. This paper proposes an alternative, grounding coherence in the demonstrated viability of knowledge systems, measured by cost minimization (Quine 1960; Kitcher 1993).

Our response is distinctive: coherence rests not on historical accident but on emergent necessary structure. Reality's pragmatic constraints—physical laws, biological limits, logical requirements, coordination necessities—form a topology necessarily generating optimal configurations. These structures emerge from the constraint landscape itself, existing whether discovered or not, just as the lowest-energy state of a molecule emerges from quantum mechanics whether calculated or not. Objective truth is alignment with these emergent, constraint-determined structures.

Context:
Crucially, historical filtering is a discovery process, not a creation mechanism. The Apex Network is not simply what happened to survive; it is the optimal structure that must exist given the constraint space of reality. Our fallible history is how we produce the map; it is not what creates the territory. Failed systems reveal where the constraint landscape drops off; successful systems triangulate toward peaks emerging necessarily from reality's organization.

This paper grounds coherence in demonstrated viability of entire knowledge systems, measured through their capacity to minimize systemic costs. Drawing from resilience theory (Holling 1973), we explain how individuals' holistic revisions to personal webs of belief in response to recalcitrant experiences, which we term pragmatic pushback, drive bottom-up formation of viable public knowledge systems.

This transforms the isolation objection: a coherent system detached from reality isn't truly possible because constraints force convergence toward viable configurations. A perfectly coherent flat-earth cosmology generates catastrophic navigational costs. A coherent phlogiston chemistry generates accelerating conceptual debt. These aren't merely false but structurally unstable, misaligned with constraint topology. The process is painstaking construction of a reef chart from empirical data of shipwrecks. Successful systems navigate safe channels revealed by failures, triangulating toward viable peaks. The Apex Network is the structure remaining when all unstable configurations are eliminated.

## 2. The Core Concepts: Units of Epistemic Selection

Understanding how knowledge systems evolve and thrive while others collapse requires assessing their structural health. A naturalistic theory needs functional tools for this analysis, moving beyond internal consistency to gauge resilience against real-world pressures. Following complex systems theory (Meadows 2008), this section traces how private belief becomes a public, functional component of knowledge systems.

### 2.1 Forging the Instruments: From Private Belief to Public Tool

Following naturalized epistemology (Goldman 1979; Kitcher 1993), this framework shifts from private psychological states to public, functional structures. This makes analysis tractable through observable phenomena while addressing epistemic systems transcending individual cognition. By grounding epistemic norms in the demonstrated viability of knowledge systems, the framework addresses Kim's (1988) normativity objection: normative force emerges from the pragmatic consequences of misalignment with constraint-determined structures. Following Quine's engineering model (Moghaddam 2013), epistemic norms function as hypothetical imperatives—if your goal is sustainable knowledge production, then minimize systemic brittleness.

**Shared Network:** Emergent public architecture of coherent propositions and predicates shared across individual belief webs for collective problem-solving. Networks nest hierarchically (germ theory within medicine within science). Their emergence is structural necessity, not negotiation: failure-driven revisions converge on viable principles, forming transmissible public knowledge.

Drawing from evolutionary epistemology (Campbell 1974; Bradie 1986) and cultural evolution (Mesoudi 2011), networks' informational structure (Standing Predicates) acts as replicator—copied code—while social groups are interactor—physical vessels for testing. This explains knowledge persistence beyond societies (e.g., rediscovered Roman law). Independently formed networks reveal an objective structure underwriting successful inquiry, anticipating the Apex Network (Section 4).

### 4.1 A Negative Methodology: Charting What Fails

Constructing our reef chart begins with systematically cataloguing shipwrecks. Our account of objectivity begins not with speculative visions of final truth, but with the most unambiguous empirical evidence: large-scale systemic failure. Following Popperian insight (Popper 1959), our most secure knowledge is often of what is demonstrably unworkable. While single failed experiments can be debated, entire knowledge system collapse—descent into crippling inefficiency, intellectual stagnation, institutional decay—provides clear, non-negotiable data.

Systematic failure analysis builds the Negative Canon: an evidence-based catalogue of invalidated principles distinguishing:

### 4.2 The Apex Network: Ontological and Epistemic Status

Filtering out high-brittleness systems is not merely destructive. As unviable designs enter the Negative Canon, pragmatic selection reveals contours of an objective structure all successful inquiry is forced to approximate: the Apex Network. This is not a pre-existing metaphysical blueprint, nor reality's territory itself, nor merely our current consensus. The Apex Network is the theoretical limit-point of convergence, resonating with the classical pragmatist notion of truth as the ideal end of inquiry (Peirce 1878). Our Consensus Network is a fallible, historically-situated attempt to chart this structure; the Apex Network is the objective structure being charted.

The Apex Network's ontological status requires careful specification to avoid foundationalist overreach and relativist collapse. We propose understanding it as a "structural emergent": a real, objective pattern crystallizing from interaction between inquiry practices and environmental resistance. Consider how objective structural facts can emerge from seemingly subjective domains: while individual color preference is contingent, cross-cultural data shows striking convergence on blue. This pattern is not accident but emergent structural fact demanding naturalistic explanation. Pragmatic pushback shaping this landscape is evolutionary selection on shared biology. Human color vision was forged by navigating terrestrial environments, where efficiently tracking ecologically critical signals, such as safe water and ripe fruit, conferred viability advantage (Berlin and Kay 1969; Henrich 2015). The Apex Network has the same ontological status: not found but formed, the objective structural residue after pragmatic filtering has eliminated less viable alternatives.

Citation: (Rescher 1996)

Context:
The Apex Network's function as standard for objective truth follows from this status. Using Susan Haack's (1993) crossword puzzle analogy: a proposition is objectively true because it is an indispensable component of the unique, fully completed, maximally coherent solution to the entire puzzle—a solution disciplined by thousands of external "clues" as pragmatic pushback.

This process is retrospective and eliminative, not teleological. Individual agents and networks solve local problems and reduce costs. The Apex Network is the objective, convergent pattern emerging as unintended consequence of countless local efforts to survive the failure filter. Its objectivity arises from the mind-independent nature of pragmatic constraints reliably generating costs for violating systems. This view resonates with process metaphysics (Rescher 1996), understanding the objective structure as constituted by the historical process of inquiry itself, not as a pre-existing static form.

The Apex Network's status is dual, a distinction critical to our fallibilist realism. Ontologically, it is real: the objective, mind-independent structure of viability that exists whether we correctly perceive it or not. Epistemically, it remains a regulative ideal. We can never achieve final confirmation our Consensus Network perfectly maps it; our knowledge is necessarily incomplete and fallible. Its existence grounds our realism and prevents collapse into relativism, while our epistemic limitations make inquiry a permanent and progressive project.

### 4.3 A Three-Level Framework for Truth

This emergent structure grounds a fallibilist but realist account of truth. It resolves the isolation objection and clarifies a documented tension in Quine's thought between truth as immanent to our best theory and truth as a transcendent regulative ideal (Tauriainen 2017). Our framework shows these are not contradictory but two necessary components of a naturalistic epistemology. It reframes truth as a status propositions earn through increasingly rigorous stages of validation.

* **Level 3: Contextual Coherence.** The baseline status for any claim. A proposition is coherent within a specific Shared Network, regardless of that network's long-term viability. This level explains the internal rationality of failed or fictional systems, but the framework's externalist check, the assessment of systemic brittleness, prevents this from being mistaken for justified truth.
* **Level 2: Justified Truth.** The highest epistemic status practically achievable. A proposition is justified as true if it is certified by a Consensus Network that has a demonstrated track record of low systemic brittleness. For all rational purposes, we are licensed to treat such claims as true. The diagnosed health of the certifying network provides powerful higher-order evidence that functions as a defeater for radical skepticism. To doubt a claim at this level, without new evidence of rising brittleness, is to doubt the entire adaptive project of science itself.

**Quine's Hard Core and Functional Entrenchment**

Quine famously argued that no claim is immune to revision in principle, yet some claims are practically unrevisable because revising them would require dismantling too much of our knowledge structure. Our framework explains this tension through the concept of functional entrenchment driven by bounded rationality (Simon 1972).

A proposition migrates to the hard core not through metaphysical necessity but through pragmatic indispensability. The costs of revision become effectively infinite:

**Animating Quine's Web: From Static Structure to Dynamic Process**

Quine's "Web of Belief" (Quine 1951, 1960) provided a powerful static model of confirmational holism, but it has been criticized for lacking a dynamic account of its formation and change. Our framework provides the missing mechanisms.

First, pragmatic pushback supplies the externalist filter that grounds the web in mind-independent reality, decisively solving the isolation objection that haunts purely internalist readings. This relentless, non-discursive filter of real-world consequences prevents the web from floating free of constraints.

This relentless, non-discursive filter of real-world consequences prevents the web from floating free of constraints.

Second, the entrenchment of pragmatically indispensable principles in the system's core provides a directed learning mechanism. A proposition migrates to the core not by convention but because it has demonstrated immense value in lowering the entire network's systemic brittleness, making its revision catastrophically costly. This process, driven by bounded rationality (Simon 1972), functions as systemic caching: proven principles are preserved to avoid re-derivation costs. For example, Conservation of Energy became entrenched after proving indispensable across domains, its revision now prohibitively expensive.

Together, these two mechanisms animate Quine's static web. Pragmatic pushback provides the external discipline, and the entrenchment of low-brittleness principles explains how the web's resilient core is systematically constructed over time (Carlson 2015). This transforms the web from a mere logical snapshot into a dynamic, evolving reef chart, where propositions earn their place through demonstrated navigational success. Core principles achieve Justified Truth (Level 2) through this process of systematic, externally-validated selection.

Citation: (Price 1992)

Context:
The historical process of pragmatic filtering gives our evolving Consensus Networks a discernible structure, which can be understood as having two distinct epistemic zones. This distinction is not about the nature of reality itself, but describes the justificatory status of our claims at a given time.

* **The Convergent Core:** This represents the load-bearing foundations of our current knowledge. It comprises domains where the relentless pressure of pragmatic selection has eliminated all known rival formulations, leaving a single, or functionally identical, set of low-brittleness principles. Principles reside in this core, such as the laws of thermodynamics or the germ theory of disease, not because they are dogmatically held or self-evident but because all tested alternatives have been relegated to the Negative Canon after generating catastrophically high systemic costs. While no claim is immune to revision in principle, the principles in the Convergent Core are functionally unrevisable in practice, as doing so would require dismantling the most successful and resilient knowledge structures we have ever built. A claim from this core achieves the highest degree of justification we can assign, approaching our standard for Objective Truth (Level 1).
* **The Pluralist Frontier:** This describes the domains of active research where our current evidence is insufficient to decide between multiple, competing, and viable reconstructions of the landscape of viability. Here, rival systems (e.g., different interpretations of quantum mechanics or competing models of consciousness) may coexist, each with a demonstrably low and stable degree of brittleness. It is crucial to distinguish this constrained, evidence-based pluralism from relativism. The frontier is not an "anything goes" zone but a highly restricted space strictly bounded on all sides by the Negative Canon. A system based on phlogiston is not a "viable contender" on the frontier of chemistry but a demonstrably failed research program. This pluralism is therefore a sign of epistemic underdetermination: a feature of our map's current limitations, not reality's supposed indifference. This position resonates with pragmatist accounts of functional pluralism (Price 1992), which treat different conceptual frameworks as tools whose legitimacy is determined by their utility within a specific practice. Within this frontier, the core claims of each viable competing system can be granted the status of Justified Truth (Level 2). This is also the zone where non-epistemic factors, such as institutional power or contingent path dependencies, can play their most significant role, sometimes artificially constraining the range of options explored or creating temporary monopolies on what is considered justified.

### 4.5 Illustrative Cases of Convergence and Brittleness

The transition from Newtonian to relativistic physics offers a canonical example of this framework's diagnostic application. After centuries of viability, the Newtonian system began to accumulate significant systemic costs in the late 19th century. These manifested as first-order predictive failures, such as its inability to account for the perihelion of Mercury, and as rising conceptual debt in the form of ad-hoc modifications like the Lorentz-FitzGerald contraction hypothesis. This accumulating brittleness created what Kuhn (1962) termed a "crisis" state preceding paradigm shifts. The Einsteinian system proved a more resilient solution, reducing this conceptual debt and substantially lowering the systemic costs of inquiry in physics.

A more contemporary case can be found in the recent history of artificial intelligence, which illustrates how a brittleness assessment might function in real time. The periodic "AI winters" can be understood as the collapse of high-brittleness paradigms, such as symbolic AI, which suffered from a high rate of ad-hoc modification when faced with novel challenges. While the subsequent deep learning paradigm proved a low-brittleness solution for many specific tasks, it may now be showing signs of rising systemic costs. These can be described conceptually as, for example, potentially unsustainable escalations in computational and energy resources for marginal performance gains, or an accelerating research focus on auxiliary, post-hoc modifications rather than on foundational architectural advances. This situation illustrates the Pluralist Frontier in action, as rival architectures might now be seen as competing to become the next low-brittleness solution.

### 4.6 Navigating the Landscape: Fitness Traps, Path Dependence, and the Role of Power

An evolutionary model of knowledge must account for the complexities of history, not just an idealized linear progress. The landscape of viability is not smooth: knowledge systems can become entrenched in suboptimal but locally stable states, which we term "fitness traps" (Wright 1932). This section clarifies how the framework incorporates factors like path dependence and institutional power not as external exceptions but as core variables that explain these historical dynamics. The model's claim is not deterministic prediction but probabilistic analysis: beneath the surface-level contingency historians rightly emphasize, underlying structural pressures create statistical tendencies over long timescales. A system accumulating brittleness is not fated to collapse on a specific date but becomes progressively more vulnerable to contingent shocks. The model thus complements historical explanation by offering tools to understand why some systems prove more resilient than others.

A system can become locked into a high-brittleness fitness trap by coercive institutions or other path-dependent factors. A slave economy, for instance, is a classic example. While objectively brittle in the long run, it creates institutional structures that make escaping the trap prohibitively costly in the short term (Acemoglu and Robinson 2012). The framework's key insight is that the exercise of power does not negate a system's brittleness; rather, the costs of maintaining that power become a primary indicator of it. This power manifests in two interrelated ways. First is its defensive role: the immense coercive overheads required to suppress dissent and manage internal friction are a direct measure of the energy a system must expend to resist the structural pressures pushing it toward collapse.

This power manifests in two interrelated ways. First is its defensive role: the immense coercive overheads required to suppress dissent and manage internal friction are a direct measure of the energy a system must expend to resist the structural pressures pushing it toward collapse.

Second, power plays a constitutive role by actively shaping the epistemic landscape. Powerful institutions can define what counts as a legitimate problem, control research funding to suppress rival networks, and entrench the very path dependencies that reinforce a fitness trap. This pattern of epistemic capture appears across domains: from tobacco companies suppressing health research to colonial knowledge systems that extracted Indigenous insights while denying reciprocal engagement, thereby masking brittleness through institutional dominance. While this can create a temporary monopoly on justification, the framework can still diagnose the system's underlying brittleness. The costs of this constitutive power often manifest as a lack of adaptability, suppressed innovation, and a growing inability to solve novel problems that fall outside the officially sanctioned domain. To detect such hidden brittleness, we can augment C(t) with sub-metrics for innovation stagnation, tracking lags in novel applications or cross-domain extensions relative to comparable systems as proxies for suppressed adaptive capacity. Over historical time, even the most entrenched systems face novel shocks, where the hidden costs of their power-induced rigidity are typically revealed.

Over historical time, even the most entrenched systems face novel shocks, where the hidden costs of their power-induced rigidity are typically revealed.

The severity of a fitness trap can be metricized, providing an empirical check on these dynamics. Drawing on cliodynamic analysis, Turchin (2003) has shown that the ratio of defensive coercive overheads to a state’s productive capacity can serve as a powerful indicator of rising systemic fragility. For instance, historical polities where such overheads consumed over 30% of state resources for a sustained period exhibited a significantly higher probability of fragmentation when faced with an external shock. This provides a concrete method for diagnosing the depth of a fitness trap: by tracking the measurable, defensive costs a system must pay to enforce its power-induced constraints on inquiry and social organization.

Finally, it is necessary to distinguish this high-brittleness fitness trap from a different state: low-brittleness stagnation. A system can achieve a locally stable, low-cost equilibrium that is highly resilient to existing shocks but lacks the mechanisms for generating novel solutions. A traditional craft perfected for a stable environment but unable to adapt to a new material, or a scientific paradigm efficient at solving internal puzzles but resistant to revolutionary change, exemplifies this state. While not actively accumulating systemic costs, such a system is vulnerable to a different kind of failure: obsolescence in the face of a faster-adapting competitor. Diagnosing this condition requires not only a static assessment of current brittleness but also an analysis of the system's rate of adaptive innovation. True long-term viability therefore requires a balance between low-cost stability and adaptive capacity. This evolutionary perspective completes our reef chart, not as a finished map, but as an ongoing process of hazard detection and channel discovery.

### 5.3 Power, Suppression, and the Hard Core

Engaging with insights from feminist epistemology (Harding 1991), we can see that even mathematics is not immune to power dynamics that generate brittleness. When a dominant mathematical community uses institutional power to suppress alternative approaches, this incurs measurable Coercive Overheads (C(t)):

**Mechanisms of Mathematical Suppression:**
- Career punishment for heterodox approaches to foundations or proof methods

1. Revising logic requires using logic to assess the revision
2. This creates infinite regress or circularity
3. Therefore logic exhibits infinite brittleness if removed
4. Systems under bounded rationality (Simon 1972) must treat such maximal-cost revisions as core

**This is pragmatic necessity, not a priori truth:**
- Logic could theoretically be revised if we encountered genuine pragmatic pressure sufficient to justify the cost

### 6.1 A Grounded Coherentism and a Naturalized Structural Realism

While internalist coherentists like Carlson (2015) have successfully shown that the web must have a functionally indispensable core, they lack resources to explain why that core is forged by external discipline. Systemic Externalism provides this missing causal engine, grounding Carlson's internal structure in an externalist history of pragmatic selection. Justification requires coherence plus network reliability via low brittleness. Unlike static network epistemology (Zollman 2013; Rosenstock et al. 2017), our model examines evolving networks under pushback.

#### 6.1.1 A Naturalistic Engine for Structural Realism

The Apex Network aligns with structural realism (Worrall 1989), providing its missing naturalistic engine. It explains convergence on objective structures via pragmatic filtering: brittle theories fail systematically, low-brittleness ones survive. The historical record shows systematic elimination of high-brittleness systems. The convergence toward low-brittleness structures, documented in the Negative Canon, provides positive inductive grounds for realism about the objective viability landscape our theories progressively map.

This provides an evolutionary, pragmatic engine for Ontic Structural Realism (Ladyman and Ross 2007). While OSR posits that the world is fundamentally structural, our framework explains how scientific practices are forced to converge on these objective structures through pragmatic filtering. The Apex Network is the complete set of viable relational structures, an emergent fact about our world's constraint topology, discovered through pragmatic selection.

Systemic Externalism contrasts with Process Reliabilism (Goldman 1979) and Virtue Epistemology (Zagzebski 1996). Process Reliabilism locates justification in the reliability of individual cognitive processes; Systemic Externalism shifts focus to the demonstrated historical viability of the public knowledge system that certifies the claim. Virtue Epistemology grounds justification in individual intellectual virtues; Systemic Externalism attributes resilience and adaptability to the collective system. Systemic Externalism thus offers macro-level externalism, complementing these micro-level approaches.

### 6.2 A Realist Corrective to Neopragmatism and Social Epistemology

The framework developed here retains pragmatism's anti-foundationalist spirit and focus on inquiry as a social, problem-solving practice. Its core ambition aligns with the foundational project of classical pragmatism: to articulate a non-reductive naturalism that can explain the emergence of genuine novelty in the world (Baggio and Parravicini 2019). However, our model offers a crucial corrective to neopragmatist approaches that are vulnerable to the charge of conflating epistemic values with mere practical utility (Putnam 2002; Lynch 2009) or reducing objectivity to social consensus. Thinkers like Rorty (1979) and Brandom (1994), in their sophisticated accounts of justification as a linguistic or social practice, lack a robust, non-discursive external constraint. This leaves them with inadequate resources for handling cases where entire communities, through well-managed discourse, converge on unviable beliefs.

Our framework provides this missing external constraint through its analysis of systemic failure. The collapse of Lysenkoist biology in the Soviet Union, for instance, was not due to a breakdown in its internal "game of giving and asking for reasons"—indeed, that discourse was brutally enforced. Its failure was a matter of catastrophic first-order costs that no amount of conversational management could prevent. This focus on pragmatic consequence as a real, external filter allows us to distinguish our position from other forms of "pragmatic realism." El-Hani and Pihlström (2002), for example, resolve the emergentist dilemma by arguing that emergent properties "gain their ontological status from the practice-laden ontological commitments we make." While we agree that justification is tied to practice, our model grounds this process in a more robustly externalist manner. Pragmatic viability is not the source of objectivity; it is the primary empirical indicator of a system's alignment with the mind-independent, emergent structure of the Apex Network.

This leads to a key reframing of the relationship between agreement and truth. Genuine solidarity is not an alternative to objectivity but an emergent property of low-brittleness systems that have successfully adapted to pragmatic constraints. The practical project of cultivating viable knowledge systems is therefore the most secure path to enduring agreement. This stands in sharp contrast to any attempt to define truth as a stable consensus within a closed system, a procedure that our framework would diagnose as a potential coherence trap lacking the necessary externalist check of real-world systemic costs.

Similarly, our framework provides an evolutionary grounding for the core insights of **social epistemology** (Goldman 1999; Longino 2002). Social epistemic procedures like peer review and institutionalized criticism are not justified a priori; they persist because they are evolved adaptive strategies that demonstrably reduce systemic brittleness by helping networks detect errors and pay down conceptual debt. This provides the externalist check that purely procedural models can lack. It also offers an empirical grounding for the central insight of standpoint theory (Harding 1991; Lugones 2003), naturalizing the idea that marginalized perspectives can be a privileged source of data about a system's hidden costs. In our model, marginalized perspectives are not privileged due to a metaphysical claim about identity, but because they often function as the most sensitive detectors of a system's First-Order Costs and hidden Coercive Overheads (C(t)). A system that appears stable to its beneficiaries may be generating immense, unacknowledged costs for those at its margins. Suppressing these perspectives is therefore not just a moral failure, but a critical epistemic failure that allows brittleness to accumulate undetected. This view of collective knowledge as an emergent, adaptive process finds resonance in contemporary work on dynamic holism (Sims 2024).

### 6.3 Distinguishing from Lakatos and Laudan

While our framework shares a historical-diagnostic ambition with Lakatos (1970) and Laudan (1977), it differs fundamentally: they provide retrospective descriptions of scientific change; we offer a forward-looking causal engine via quantifiable brittleness. Brittleness measures accumulated costs causing degeneration, serving as a real-time diagnostic of structural health, not merely historical output.

Similarly, while Laudan's model evaluates a theory based on the number and importance of the empirical problems it solves, our approach is subtly different. Systemic brittleness is a forward-looking measure of epistemic risk and resilience (Pritchard 2016). A system could have a high problem-solving score in Laudan's sense while simultaneously accumulating hidden systemic costs (like massive computational overheads or conceptual debt) that make it profoundly vulnerable to future shocks. Our framework is thus less a retrospective accounting of solved puzzles and more a real-time assessment of a system's long-term viability and adaptive efficiency.

### 6.4 Plantinga's Challenge: Does Evolution Select for Truth or Mere Survival?

Alvin Plantinga's Evolutionary Argument Against Naturalism (EAAN) poses a formidable challenge to any naturalistic epistemology: if our cognitive faculties are products of natural selection, and natural selection optimizes for reproductive success rather than true belief, then we have no reason to trust that our faculties reliably produce true beliefs (Plantinga 1993, 2011). Evolution could equip us with systematically false but adaptive beliefs—useful fictions that enhance survival without tracking reality. If naturalism is true, the very faculties we use to conclude naturalism is true are unreliable, rendering naturalism self-defeating.

Our framework provides a novel response by collapsing Plantinga's proposed gap between adaptive success and truth-tracking. We argue that in domains where systematic misrepresentation generates costs, survival pressure and truth-tracking converge necessarily. This is not because evolution "cares about" truth, but because reality's constraint structure makes persistent falsehood unsustainable.

Context:
As a macro-epistemology explaining the long-term viability of public knowledge systems, this framework does not primarily solve micro-epistemological problems like Gettier cases. Instead, it bridges the two levels through the concept of higher-order evidence: the diagnosed health of a public system provides a powerful defeater or corroborator for an individual's beliefs derived from that system.

The diagnosed brittleness of a knowledge system provides higher-order evidence that determines rational priors. Following Kelly (2005) on disagreement, when an agent receives a claim, they must condition their belief not only on the first-order evidence but also on the source's reliability. Let S be a high-brittleness network (e.g., a denialist documentary). Even if it presents seemingly compelling evidence E, an agent's prior probability in S's reliability is extremely low due to its history of rising P(t), C(t), and predictive failure. Thus, the posterior confidence in the claim remains low. Conversely, a low-brittleness network like the IPCC earns a high prior through demonstrated resilience. To doubt its claims without new evidence of rising brittleness is to doubt the entire adaptive project of science itself. This provides a rational, non-deferential basis for trust: justification flows from systemic health, grounding micro-level belief in macro-level viability.

The framework for assessing brittleness is general, but its application reveals two primary modalities of failure, corresponding to the different kinds of pragmatic constraints a network can violate. This distinction clarifies how our approach unifies descriptive and normative inquiry under a single explanatory mechanism.

* **Normative Brittleness:** This is the modality of failure resulting from a misalignment with the emergent normative structure of the world. It is found in socio-political and ethical networks whose primary function is to organize cooperative human action. The specific mechanism for this failure can be precisely articulated through a theory of emergent moral properties. Drawing on Baysan's (2025) account of emergent moral non-naturalism, we can understand objective moral properties as conferring noncausal powers. While a causal power manifests as a physical change, a noncausal power manifests as the obtaining of a normative fact. For example, the property of being unjust confers on an institution the noncausal power to justify resentment and require condemnation. A network's alignment with this structure is not optional. A society predicated on slavery, for instance, exhibits profound normative brittleness because it must expend immense real-world energy to counteract these noncausal powers. The immense coercive overheads required to maintain the institution are the direct, measurable, and causal signature of a system struggling to suppress the real normative fact that its core practices justify resistance. This account requires that we move beyond what Bennett-Hunter (2015) calls the 'causalist assumption'—the dictum that 'to be real is to have causal power'—and recognize that a causal vocabulary may not be appropriate for every explanatory domain (El-Hani and Pihlström 2002). This macro-level diagnosis finds a plausible correlate in agent-level moral psychology, where moral intuitions can be understood as evolved detectors for such "response-invoking" features of our environment (Rottschaefer 2012) that signal potential systemic costs if ignored, a direct experience of what Peter (2024) calls the "demands of fittingness."
