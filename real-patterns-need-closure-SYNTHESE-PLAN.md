# Guiding Plan for `real-patterns-need-closure-SYNTHESE.md`

## 1. Purpose of the New Version

This document sets the writing strategy for a Synthese-targeted version of `real-patterns-as-closure.md`.

The goal is not to reinvent the argument. The goal is to produce a tighter paper with one primary claim, explicit novelty, and disciplined scope.

The target manuscript is `real-patterns-need-closure-SYNTHESE.md`.

## 2. Core Thesis to Preserve

The paper defends one central claim:

For a fixed regime, horizon, and admissible intervention class, a macro-pattern qualifies for macro-objecthood when macrostate information is sufficient for macro-transition structure, so within-class micro-differences do not change macro-level what-follows.

Supporting structure:

1. In exact Markov settings, this is captured by strong lumpability.
2. In realistic settings, closure is graded via leakiness and convergent diagnostics.
3. This yields a non-instrumentalist, anti-gerrymandering realism criterion compatible with microphysical completeness.

## 2.1 Philosophical Commitments and Dialectical Posture

State these commitments explicitly in the draft, then defend them without overreach.

1. Structural realist orientation at the macro-level.
2. Interventionist reading of causal relevance for objecthood claims.
3. Regime-relativity without observer-relativism.
4. Priority of transition structure over static description.

Dialectical posture:

1. We are offering a constrained criterion, not a complete metaphysics of everything.
2. The strongest claim is conditional on explicit commitments.
3. A narrower anti-gerrymandering conclusion remains even for readers with different priors.

## 2.2 The Main Philosophical Move

The paper's central move should be written as a sequence:

1. Dennett's realism insight is right but underconstrained.
2. Compression alone cannot exclude dynamically idle or gerrymandered aggregates.
3. Closure adds the missing discriminating condition.
4. Lumpability gives an exact benchmark for one clean formal setting.
5. Leakiness extends the criterion to realistic non-ideal conditions.
6. Therefore, realism is preserved but disciplined.

This sequence should appear clearly in the introduction and reappear in compressed form in the conclusion.

## 3. Why a New Synthese Version is Needed

The current paper is strong but broad. It combines criterion construction, multiple applications, composition debate, and methodological detail.

For Synthese, the paper should foreground one argumentative engine and reduce side programs that look like companion-paper material.

This new version improves publishability by:

1. Tightening scope.
2. Reducing redundancy and conceptual echo.
3. Increasing dialectical precision against obvious reviewer objections.
4. Making novelty legible against Dennett, Rosas, and interventionist frameworks.

## 4. Voice and Style Commitments

Use these constraints throughout drafting:

1. Clear, measured, philosophically precise prose.
2. Authoritative but not overconfident.
3. Complexity in argument structure, not sentence syntax.
4. No grandstanding, no manifesto tone.
5. No unnecessary named concepts.
6. No em dashes.
7. Keep variables in LaTeX format.
8. Examples are conceptual illustrations, not empirical proof.
9. No pseudo-quantification.

## 4.1 Clarity and Simplicity Protocol

Apply these rules at sentence and paragraph level:

1. Prefer one claim per sentence in argumentative passages.
2. Use short bridge sentences when moving from concept to formalism.
3. Replace abstract connectors with explicit causal links.
4. Define terms once, then use them consistently.
5. Avoid re-explaining the same point in near-identical wording.
6. Keep formal notation support-focused, then restate in plain language.
7. If a paragraph has more than one caveat, split it.

Readability checks before each major revision:

1. Could a skeptical graduate reader restate the paragraph's point in one sentence?
2. Does each paragraph end with a claim that sets up the next paragraph?
3. Did any sentence become dense enough to hide the core claim?

## 5. Scope Boundaries for the Synthese Version

2. Closure criterion in clear prose and formal statement.
3. Strong lumpability as exact benchmark.
4. Graded closure via leakiness, with procedural safeguards.
5. Admissibility hierarchy and anti-circularity defense.
6. Focused objection section, especially instrumentalism and causal exclusion.

## 6.1 Target Length and Proportion Guide

Use this as a hard budgeting tool to prevent scope creep.

1. Abstract: 150 to 200 words.
2. Introduction: 1200 to 1600 words.
3. Criterion and admissibility: 1500 to 2000 words.

5. Approximate closure: 1500 to 2000 words.
6. Objections and replies: 1800 to 2400 words.
7. Conclusion: 600 to 900 words.

Main text target: 9000 to 11000 words.

If a section exceeds budget, cut before adding new material.

## 6.2 Red-Line Scope Rules

These are mandatory constraints for the Synthese draft.

1. No more than two detailed application illustrations in main text.
2. No standalone composition program in main text.
3. No algorithmic detail beyond what is needed to defend philosophical legitimacy.
4. No new framework-level terminology unless removing ambiguity requires it.
5. No paragraph that introduces a major claim without a clear tie to the core criterion.

## 7. Required Moves by Section

### Introduction

Must do:

1. State one thesis in one sentence.
2. Name the exact gap in Dennett that this paper fills.
3. Distinguish this project from broad pattern realism and from pure methodology.
4. Provide a concise contribution map.

### Criterion Section

Must do:

1. Give a plain-language criterion before formal notation.
2. Define regime, horizon, admissible intervention class once.
3. Clarify that admissibility is fixed upstream of objecthood verdicts.
4. State anti-gerrymandering role explicitly.

### Formal Benchmark Section

Must do:

1. Present strong lumpability as sufficient ideal benchmark.
2. Explicitly deny that this is the only admissible formal setting.
3. Keep proof material concise in main text.

### Approximate Closure Section

Must do:

1. Define leakiness as canonical target quantity.
2. Clarify estimator and proxy relation without metric relativism.
3. State procedural safeguards against back-fitting.
4. Keep threshold language comparative and procedural.

### Objections Section

Must do:

1. Instrumentalism objection and hierarchy reply.
2. Admissibility circularity objection and upstream reply.
3. Causal exclusion objection with non-redundancy in explanatory and control structure.
4. Markov-restriction objection with non-Markov extension framing.
5. Abstract-object scope objection with stipulated vs induced closure distinction.

### Conclusion

Must do:

1. Restate novelty as one precise upgrade over Dennett-style pattern realism.
2. State what is gained philosophically and what is deliberately left open.
3. End with bounded future work, not framework expansion rhetoric.

## 7.1 Argumentative Moves That Must Be Explicit

Use these moves as explicit writing targets.

1. **From usefulness to objecthood discipline:** useful models can track real structure, but usefulness alone is not sufficient for objecthood.
2. **From formal benchmark to realistic application:** strong lumpability is the exact case, leakiness is the operational extension.
3. **From admissibility choice to constraint determination:** intervention classes are fixed by physically implementable channels, not analyst preference.
4. **From epistemic limitation to metaphysical stability:** estimation difficulty constrains our access, not the underlying criterion.
5. **From microphysical completeness to macro non-redundancy:** macro-level closure secures explanatory and interventional autonomy without denying micro implementation.

## 7.2 Distinctions the Draft Must Keep Sharp

These distinctions prevent reviewer misunderstandings.

1. Pattern reality versus macro-objecthood.
2. Stipulated closure versus induced closure.
3. Predictive closure versus interventional closure.
4. Ontological standard versus operational proxy.
5. Constraint-relative objectivity versus observer-relativity.
6. Regime dependence versus arbitrariness.

## 8. Content That Must Be Present

These are non-negotiable for this version:

1. A single canonical criterion sentence.
2. Clear distinction between stipulated and induced closure.
3. Explicit conditional commitment structure for readers with different metaphysical priors.
4. Statement that practical estimation limits are epistemic limits, not defeaters of the metaphysical criterion.
5. Clear distinction between ontological standard and operational diagnostics.

## 9. Content to Avoid or Minimize

1. New capitalized theoretical labels.
2. Claims that sound like complete general metaphysics.
3. Overextended domain tours that dilute the core argument.
4. Technical implementation detail that reads like an ML methods paper.
5. Repetition of the full criterion in near-identical wording.

## 10. Citation and Positioning Strategy

Anchor conversation around:

1. Dennett on real patterns.
2. Rosas et al. on closure and lumpability.
3. Woodward and Pearl on intervention and causal interpretation.
4. Focused engagement with Kim-style exclusion pressure.
5. Ladyman and Ross where projectibility and structural realism support the framing.

Use citations to establish dialogue and novelty, not citation volume.

## 10.1 Positioning Claims to Repeat in the Draft

These claims should appear in intro, one middle transition, and conclusion.

1. This paper is a tightening of real-pattern realism, not a rejection.
2. The novelty is a discriminating closure criterion that excludes gerrymandered partitions.
3. Strong lumpability is a benchmark case, not the whole metaphysical claim.
4. Approximate closure is philosophically legitimate when governed by fixed constraints and comparative diagnostics.

## 10.3 Novelty Script for Intro and Abstract

Use a stable three-sentence novelty script.

1. Existing real-pattern realism captures compression but leaves anti-gerrymandering underconstrained.
2. This paper proposes closure under fixed regime, horizon, and admissible interventions as the missing discriminating condition.
3. It unifies exact and approximate cases by treating strong lumpability as benchmark and leakiness-governed diagnostics as disciplined non-ideal extension.

This script should appear in abstract form, introduction form, and conclusion form with minimal wording drift.

## 10.2 Literature Dialogue Moves

For each core interlocutor, make one clear contrast.

1. **Dennett:** preserve compression realism, add anti-gerrymandering criterion.
2. **Rosas et al.:** use formal closure diagnostics, extend to philosophical objecthood criterion and graded non-ideal application.
3. **Woodward and Pearl:** interpret macro-level stability in interventionist terms.
4. **Kim-style exclusion pressure:** defend non-redundancy at explanatory and control levels.
5. **Ladyman and Ross:** align with structural and projectibility concerns while keeping criterion explicit.

## 11. Dialectical Risks and Preemption

### Risk 1: Instrumentalism relapse

Preempt by:

1. Separating target selection from closure verdict.
2. Stating constraint-relative, not observer-relative, objectivity.

### Risk 2: Admissibility circularity

Preempt by:

1. Upstream fixation of intervention class.
2. Hierarchical evaluation order.
3. Disclosure and restart rule for post hoc changes.

### Risk 3: Causal exclusion

Preempt by:

1. Clarifying non-competition with microphysical implementation.
2. Arguing non-redundancy at explanatory and interventional level.

### Risk 4: Overreach

Preempt by:

1. Explicit scope lines.
2. Clear statement of what is left for companion papers.

### Risk 5: Prior mismatch and avoidable misunderstanding

Preempt by:

1. Stating commitment structure explicitly and early.
2. Separating strongest claim from fallback claim for readers with different priors.
3. Marking the difference between conditional sufficiency and necessary anti-gerrymandering constraints.
4. Clarifying that epistemic difficulty in estimation does not defeat the metaphysical criterion.
5. Distinguishing induced closure claims from claims about formal or abstract domains.

## 11.1 Prior-Sensitivity Drafting Notes

Use this template logic in contested sections:

1. State the strongest claim under the paper's commitments.
2. State what follows even if those commitments are not accepted.
3. State what the paper does not claim.

Preferred phrasing pattern:

"If one accepts [commitment set], then [strong conclusion]. Even if one withholds [commitment], [narrower conclusion] still follows."

Avoid:

1. Framing disagreement as confusion or bad faith.
2. Treating alternative metaphysical priors as irrational.
3. Writing as if acceptance of structural realism is dialectically mandatory.

## 12. Drafting Workflow

### Phase A: Skeleton

1. Build section headings and one thesis sentence per section.
2. Remove non-core subsections before rewriting prose.

### Phase B: Argument Core

1. Write Sections 1 to 5 first.
2. Lock definitions before objections.

### Phase C: Objections

1. Rewrite objections in strongest form.
2. Answer with direct, non-defensive prose.

### Phase D: Flow and Compression

1. Remove echo and duplicated clarifiers.
2. Enforce linear baton-pass transitions.

### Phase D.1: Philosophical Coherence Audit

Before polish, run this audit:

1. Does every major claim trace back to the core criterion?
2. Are any sections arguing for more than the thesis requires?
3. Are objections answered at the same abstraction level as they are raised?
4. Is any response relying on rhetorical force instead of conceptual distinction?
5. Does each section strengthen resilience rather than add novelty drift?

### Phase E: Submission Polish

1. Verify style constraints from `STYLE_GUIDE.md`.
2. Verify citation integrity and scope discipline.
3. Generate release for review.

## 13. Acceptance Checklist for the New Draft

The draft is ready for journal submission review only if:

1. A skeptical reviewer can state the thesis in one sentence after reading the introduction.
2. Novelty over Dennett plus Rosas is explicit and non-inflated.
3. Main text reads as philosophy first, formalism second.
4. Objections section addresses likely desk and referee objections directly.
5. No section feels like a separate paper trying to live inside this one.
6. The conclusion states gains, limits, and next steps without expansion drift.

## 13.1 Synthese-Facing Referee Test

The draft should survive the following likely referee prompts:

1. "What is new here beyond Dennett plus Rosas?"
2. "Why does this avoid instrumentalism rather than restate it?"
3. "Why is admissibility not circular or preference-dependent?"
4. "Why does this not collapse under causal exclusion?"
5. "Why is this still philosophy, not a methods note?"

If the manuscript cannot answer each in two to four sentences, revise before submission.

## 13.2 Desk-Reject Prevention Checklist

Before submission, verify all are true:

1. The abstract states one problem, one thesis, one novelty claim.
2. Introduction names explicit interlocutors and direct contrasts.
3. No section reads as a detached side paper.
4. Formal material is introduced as support for philosophical claims.
5. Objections section addresses strongest foreseeable reviewer versions.
6. Conclusion does not add new concepts or claims.

## 14. Working Notes for Authorial Perspective

Keep this perspective stable while drafting:

1. We are not proving a scientific hypothesis.
2. We are defending a philosophical criterion and its logical consequences.
3. Formal tools are support, not foundation.
4. Examples teach the logic. They do not bear evidential weight alone.
5. The strongest version is the most constrained version.

## 14.1 Do and Do Not Patterns for Drafting

Do:

1. State claims first, then give reasons.
2. Use "This matters because..." transitions where needed.
3. Qualify scope before a reader can object.
4. Keep objections charitable and precise.

Do not:

1. Introduce broad new metaphysical ambitions mid-draft.
2. Shift between "real pattern" and "macro-object" without signaling the level.
3. Use technical language to hide an undefended premise.
4. Treat one illustration as if it settles the argument.

## 15. First Draft Target

Draft `real-patterns-need-closure-SYNTHESE.md` as a clean manuscript rather than incremental edits from the current file, then back-port only clearly superior phrasing where needed.

Primary standard:

If a reviewer rejects the argument, it should be because they reject its metaphysical commitments, not because the paper is unclear, overextended, or methodologically loose.
